09:52:21 <bblfish> ah quite right
09:53:18 <danbri> i made some progress with the uri stuff
09:53:25 <bblfish> Was hoping to get some idea of wha the next stages for AtomOwl should be http://bblfish.net/work/atom-owl/2006-06-06/
09:53:42 <danbri> see in http://spypixel.com/2006/wcl/uri/
09:54:27 <danbri> nice diagram! (tho it'll take some digesting)
09:55:01 <bblfish> There are still quite a lot of todos. I am just making a list of them. Had I know that writing a spec takes this much time!
09:55:10 <danbri> did you borrow structure from the SIOC spec?
09:55:14 <bblfish> yes
09:55:21 <bblfish> who borrowed from foaf
09:55:23 <danbri> you've some search/replace to do then
09:55:24 <danbri> yeah :)
09:55:31 <danbri> god help 'em ;)
09:55:45 <bblfish> yes. That part is not done. Waiting for danja to fill some stuff out
09:55:54 <danbri> hey, have you played with sparql in redland at all? am trying to filter on the URI vocab structures we talked about yesterday
09:56:25 <bblfish> no. There is twinkle by the way, a nice java app
09:56:31 <grove> grove has joined #swig
09:56:33 <bblfish> to do sparql queries
09:56:34 <danbri> using http://spypixel.com/2006/wcl/uri/_data.rdf
09:56:47 <danbri> i was trying for zero install... lazy i guess
09:56:58 <danbri> mostly i use jena locally
09:57:21 <bblfish> twinkle is just a download and it works
09:57:55 <danbri> * danbri will try
09:58:01 <danbri> see http://spypixel.com/2006/wcl/uri/filter-test1.rq for test query anyways
09:58:13 <danbri> it works, but the filter isn't subsetting the data for some reason
09:58:26 <bblfish> ah
09:58:59 <bblfish> you can have regex in SPARQL?
09:59:12 <danbri> phenny, ask dajobe if he knows why http://spypixel.com/2006/wcl/uri/filter-test1.rq isn't working with http://spypixel.com/2006/wcl/uri/_data.rdf using his online SPARQL query tool at http://librdf.org/query
09:59:14 <danbri> yes
09:59:15 <phenny> danbri: I'll pass that on when dajobe is around.
09:59:33 <bblfish> anyway another case for cifps there.
09:59:41 <bblfish> or something like it

10:32:30 <dc_swig> Added comment A2.
10:34:02 <danbri> A:I think this shows how much nicer it is to have a pre-parsed structure. We can [http://spypixel.com/2006/wcl/uri/filter-test2.rq|write]  "regex(?userinfo, ":")" to find URIs that include a password, for example. Regex'ing against the entire URI is, by contrast, rather intimidating and bug-prone.

14:37:55 <danbri> hi
14:38:00 <AndyS> Hi
14:38:08 <AndyS> That SPARQL example ...
14:38:24 <danbri> am i using filters unnecessarily?
14:38:29 <AndyS> could add a URL parser as a pattern thusly:
14:38:43 <AndyS> ?url foo:components ( ?scheme ?authority  ?userinfo ?host ?port ?port ?path ?query ?fragment ) .
14:39:08 <danbri> i dont know that notation!
14:39:33 <AndyS> where fo:compoents is a property that relates URIs to its components.  Canonicallised as well (e.g. hTTp => http)
14:39:48 <AndyS> ( ) is a regular RDF list.
14:40:03 <AndyS> ?url foo:components ?someThing .
14:40:20 <libby> libby has quit
14:40:46 <AndyS> It's a magic property that evaluates rather than matches.
14:40:52 <danbri> ah, so its a modelling suggestion?
14:41:18 <AndyS> Yes - and a way to build the URL parser into the execution as well.
14:41:37 <danbri> how is the magic indicated?
14:41:46 <danbri> I've not heard of this 'foo:' namespace before ;)
14:41:54 <AndyS> By magic!
14:42:04 <danbri> of course!
14:42:11 <AndyS> foo: was just an anything marker.
14:42:23 <AndyS> cwm already does this BTW.
14:42:48 <danbri> you mean i can plug in the huge uri-parsing regex somehow?
14:42:58 <AndyS> Some properties are calculated. ARQ has a half-way-there version of it.
14:43:01 <danbri> and maybe teach arq about it via api?
14:43:06 <AndyS> Yep.
14:43:18 <danbri> ah, i used to do that with google:backLink property etc
14:43:36 <danbri> would tie me to arq though
14:44:21 <AndyS> And encourage others to add property functions.  It solves the list access use case inside legal SPARQL.
14:44:26 <danbri> tho in general a handy facility
14:44:47 <AndyS> i.e. { ?list list:member ?member . }
14:45:03 <AndyS> Also cwm already has this.  and a SPARQL parser.
14:45:33 <AndyS> Not sure how one adds new builtins to cwm but it must be possible as the cwm library does it.
14:46:27 <danbri> parsing URIs should be a built-in for semweb toolkits, i'd reckon
14:47:11 <AndyS> Ack.  C&P that regex once.  Carefully :-)
15:09:33 <sheets> sheets has joined #swig
15:11:35 <danbri> i wonder what more is needed for IRIs
15:15:06 <AndyS> That regex is only for correct URIs (e.g. accepts spaces) so maybe all that is needed is for ^ to work on all codepoints.

19:27:45 <ldodds> danja: u there?
19:28:30 <danja> here
19:28:44 <ldodds> what was the problem with Slug? Got a bug report for me/
19:30:10 <danja> I'm not really sure, seemed like when it's looking for the config resources, it's missing something
19:30:21 <danja> gimmee a minute and I'll try running it again
19:30:54 <ldodds> ok
19:36:13 <NachoAway> NachoAway is now known as NachoMan
19:37:03 <danja> ah that was it, I think _memory was null
19:37:08 <danja> check your mail
19:37:11 <ldodds> ta
19:38:34 <ldodds> what were the cmd line options?
19:38:35 <danja> line 160 of Scutter.java had me wondering :
19:38:37 <danja>  schema.read( this.getClass().getResourceAsStream("/config.rdfs"), "");
19:38:57 <danja> oh yeah
19:39:11 <danja> hang on, must be in history somewhere
19:39:13 <ldodds> the / indicates to getResourceAsStream to not pre-pend the package name
19:39:25 <danja> ok
19:39:57 <danja> * danja learns a new idoim
19:40:02 <danja> or similar
19:42:33 <ldodds> looks to me like all the scutter profiles in your config point to db-memory rather than the file system memory
19:42:39 <ldodds> not saying thats the problem, though
19:42:53 <ldodds> or are you logging to a db?
19:43:06 <danja> not that I know
19:43:35 <danja> I was wanting it to use a DB, set one up as detailed in the config
19:44:29 <danja> I think the only cmd option I ended up with was -plan plan.rdf
19:44:41 <danja> -mem seemed to be unrecognised
19:44:45 <ldodds> thats not enough -- you need to specify which scutter profile you're using
19:44:53 <danja> aaaah...
19:44:57 <danja> e.g.?

19:47:45 <bblfish> have you seen this: http://www.openiris.org/
19:47:53 <danja> that'd be nice. wonder how EliasT's getting on with implementation
19:48:24 <bblfish> Don't know.
19:49:31 <bblfish> I am just going to slurp these right into a SemWeb database and then map them to objects using So(m)mer
19:49:40 <bblfish> makes for less work
19:49:55 <danja> aye, I downloaded that at the time - Jack Park was encouraging me to play
19:50:11 <danja> slurp, yep
19:50:35 <bblfish> Looks like it only works on windows
19:50:42 <danja> some comments on IRIS from Jack : http://dannyayers.com/2006/01/26/iris/

21:43:21 <DanC> I don't really have the RETE data structures in my head, but it seems sorta feasible
21:43:49 <DanC> yes, the pass was remarkable... especially that he didn't take the shot, didn't take the shot, didn't take the shot, and then passed
21:44:21 <DanC> it was like 118 minutes of patience followed by one surgical strike ;-)

16:14:44 <ubu> NachoMan, well, Da Helper is getting mature enough that i can probably start showing my face in the RDF World ;-)
16:15:04 <ubu> still needs docs, though
16:15:19 <danbri> B:See [http://www.w3.org/2005/Incubator/geo/charter|charter]. They plan to update the geo vocabulary started in SWIG. Which I guess means I should figure out a collaboration mechanism for SWIG folks who aren't on the XG. There's a public mailing list, so should be staightforward I think....
16:15:21 <dc_swig> Added comment B1.
16:15:21 <NachoMan> ubu++; I talked about RDF::Helper ages back, but it wasn't anywhere near as cool then as it is now
16:15:21 <ubu> (not that that's a hint or anything *cough*)
16:15:25 <danbri> B:Great to see this moving along :)
16:15:26 <dc_swig> Added comment B2.

16:15:43 <danbri> B:"The mission of the Geo Incubator Group, part of the Incubator Activity, is to begin addressing issues of location and geographical properties of resources for the Web of today and tomorrow, by taking a concrete step to update the W3C GEO vocabulary, laying the groundwork for a more comprehensive geospatial ontology, and formulating a proposal for a W3C Local Web working group to develop...

16:22:39 <KjetilKWork> :-)
16:22:49 <dajobe> lol
16:23:33 <KjetilKWork> there are some docs, understandable too, but they feel like they are in the wrong place
16:23:44 <ubu> yup
16:23:50 <NachoMan> ubu: Maybe I'll play hookie from work a bit today and pound out some docs for da helpah
16:23:50 <KjetilKWork> * KjetilKWork was about to submit a patch for that, but $real_world interferred
16:24:33 <ubu> I just need to spend a weekend chainsawing through the modules and making sure that, at least, basic usage is civered.
16:24:39 <ubu> i can get fancy later

16:28:33 <darobin> * darobin giggles at reading my $type = ref $wtf
16:29:06 <ubu> :-)
16:29:26 <darobin> there's a lot of goodness in there
16:29:35 <ubu> i have to keep myself amused
16:30:09 <ubu> the most interesting parts are the DBI-alike semantics for queries
16:30:59 <ubu> while (my $row = $query->selectrow_hashref ) { and so on
16:31:03 <darobin> yup I like that
16:31:20 <darobin> one thing I was wondering about was DBI-like bound vars
16:31:39 <darobin> I mean placeholders
16:31:41 <darobin> except for SPARQL instead of SQL
16:31:43 <ubu> right
16:31:53 <ubu> hmmm
16:32:29 <darobin> yeah
16:32:48 <ubu> would be darn handy for certain spots in $work_code, too, actually
16:33:01 <ubu> * ubu makes a note
16:33:21 <darobin> well basically anytime you have something like a Web request with params for the query
16:33:33 <dajobe> placeholders, hmm
16:44:13 <danja> .g sparqlbean
16:44:16 <phenny> sparqlbean: sorry, no results were found.

20:37:45 <ubu> er "step *around*"
20:38:04 <bengee> bengee has quit
20:38:21 <kasei> are you looking at the sql compilation? or the pure-perl query engine?
20:38:39 <ubu> SQL Compilation
20:39:22 <kasei> ah, ok. that code is *very* experimental.
20:39:45 <NachoMan> NachoMan is now known as NachoAway
20:39:47 <kasei> i've committed (though not released yet) initial support for optionals.
20:39:56 <ubu> i've got it all mostly working for what i need initially, but it seems (from what i can tell) that things like FILTER() and so on aren't really "there" yet
20:39:58 <kasei> but overall i'm not sure of the coverage status of the code.
20:40:08 <ubu> k
20:40:17 <ubu> are you open to patches?
20:40:47 <kasei> absolutely.
20:40:49 <ubu> your code is nice and tidy so i'd be happy to patch where i can
20:41:38 <kasei> i believe the filter architecture for the sql compiler is all there, so it should be a smop for puting in the various functions.
20:41:43 <ubu> well... *mostly* nice and tidy (its perl after all, we're all a bit idiomatic) ;-)
20:41:50 <kasei> heh
20:42:51 <kasei> if you've not made any patches yet, i'll push out a release tonight and you could diff against that.
20:43:22 <ubu> not there yet, still getting the lay of the land, reallyL
20:43:55 <kasei> ok. if you've got any questions, i'd be happy to provide answers. if i'm not here, email is probably the best bet.
20:44:10 <ubu> well, one quicky...
20:44:59 <ubu> i couldn't get Model::SQL to DWIM
20:45:51 <ubu> i assume that i init the model, then pass that as the sole arg to $query_object->execute()
20:46:04 <ubu> but i get nothing back
20:46:09 <kasei> that doesn't surprise me. that code is all pretty crufty and left over from an old, never-released sql bridge class.
20:46:37 <ubu> k
20:47:04 <ubu> as long as its to be expected (and I'm not just a retard) i can live with it :-)
20:47:18 <kasei> no, the way to do it (at the moment, but it could change to dwim) is to pass an arg to execute (and undef as the model, i think).
20:47:46 <kasei> i didn't expect anyone to be using it quite yet, so it's all pretty rough around the edges.
20:47:56 <ubu> gotcha
20:48:17 <ubu> RDF::Helper is at the same stage, so i'm totally sympathetic
20:48:18 <dc_swig> Label RDF not found.
20:48:44 <kasei> i'll try to clean it up a bit before releasing tonight, and leave a message for you with phenny.
20:48:46 <ubu> at least your has docs :-)
20:48:58 <ubu> awesome
20:49:01 <ubu> thanks
20:49:15 <kasei> sure
20:49:26 <kasei> are there docs for rdf::helper somewhere?
20:49:39 <ubu> in progess
20:49:40 <kasei> or an overview?
20:49:59 <ubu> not really, at this pont :-/
20:50:26 <NachoAway> NachoAway is now known as NachoMan
20:50:32 <ubu> i pushed it out to CPAN under threat of beating by KjetilKWork
20:50:35 <kasei> ok. hard to tell by the stub stuff on cpan, but does it share any goals with the RDF::Query::Model classes?
20:50:58 <ubu> and have been playing catch-up to roll a *real* release
20:51:02 <kasei> (unified API to the various stores?)
20:51:06 <ubu> yes
20:51:09 <ubu> exactly
20:51:48 <ubu> plus various Perlish convenience extensions
20:52:45 <kasei> hmmm... might have to jump through some dependenccy hoops, but i'd be interested in using that when it's more stable.
20:52:54 <ubu> the idea is to offer a general unified interface that makes things easy for the perlishly-minded but doesn't block access to whatever the underlying base interface offers
20:53:45 <Kriegel> Kriegel has quit
20:54:20 <kasei> good. that was the point of the rdf::query::model classes, but that code really should be seperate.
20:56:24 <ubu> that, plus handy things like RDF::Helper::Object that gives a nice TIED-object based OO interface to RDF data and various DBI-like extensions that allow things like  $q_object->selectrow_hashref, for example) for RDF queries
20:56:58 <ubu> its pretty stable (been in production for going on a year no), just totally undocumented
20:57:12 <NachoMan> ubu and I use it as the foundation for $work
20:57:37 <EliasT> EliasT has joined #swig
21:00:32 <kasei> ok. the game is over, so I'm off for a bit. ubu: i'll release some code tonight and get back to you about handing a dbi model to execute().
21:00:39 <ubu> support for RDF::Core lags behind largely because the fact that, a year later, ::Core *still* doesn't run cleanly under strict and warn and that pisses me off
21:00:53 <ubu> great, thanks
21:02:01 <kasei> yeah, the gingerall guys really annoy me. i've got commit access to their cvs, but they seem to want to do commits themselves, and they just sit on my patches forever.
21:02:52 <kasei> maybe i should just start committing all my queued up patches and hope they make a CPAN release with them.

09:17:43 <mzechner> greetings
09:17:55 <mzechner> is one of the developers in here and would have time to answer a short question?
09:20:00 <mzechner> well i guess i just ask :). i'm using sesame 2 alpha 3 and was wondering about the insertion performance of the store, i don't use transaction but the atomar methods to add single triples
09:20:13 <mzechner> you can find the sourcecode to the small not representative bench at http://rafb.net/paste/results/HWUkcS72.html
09:22:28 <mzechner> i wrote an equivalent "bench" for jena and was amazed at how poor sesame performs compared to it when it comes to insertion and deletion of triples.  here's the rouch output of my "benches" http://rafb.net/paste/results/22qSTb51.html
09:22:42 <boneill> you may want to look at http://www.aktors.org/interns2005/benmark/index.php
09:22:53 <boneill> they did some benchmarking of different triple stores
09:22:59 <mzechner> query performance of sesame is not included as i know that sesame performs a hell lot better when it comes to queries
09:23:17 <mzechner> thanks i already had a look at those benches when i was trying to decide upon which store to use for our project
09:25:52 <mzechner> the problem is this: jena beats sesame when it comes to deletion and insertion, sesame beats jena when it comes to querying. i'd need the best from both worlds as our project heavily relies on realtime insertion and deletion of rdf triples and a lot of queries during runtime
09:26:36 <AndyS> What's the storage you're using?
09:26:44 <mzechner> i wonder wheter sesames poor performance in this area is related to the used indexing schema or to the newly introduced transactions
09:26:55 <mzechner> in memory non referenced sesame 2 alpha 3 :)

09:30:14 <mzechner> current sesame
09:30:19 <mzechner> from cvs
09:31:09 <AndyS> For Sesame, is it calculating the RDFS clsoure on input?
09:33:40 <LeoSimons> LeoSimons has joined #swig
09:34:00 <AndyS> Can you send the querying figures and I'll push them at the implementer of Jena's memory store?
09:37:02 <mzechner> i don't know wheter an rdfs closure is calculated in case of sesame. also, i hardly believe that my "benches" are anywhere close to being accurate or representative. they should just give me a rough estimate of what to expect from the two apis
09:38:01 <mzechner> in case of sesame i instantiate the repository like this sesame_model_ = new Repository( new MemoryStore() ); ( sorry for the code dump.. ) which should yield a in memory non inferenced model so the rdfs closure should not be calculated upon insertion of a new triple i think
09:38:39 <AndyS> Yes - benchmarking is tricky - many variables.

17:29:42 <chimezie> or anyone familiar with reason.n3 (timbl?).  I have a question regarding using it to represent RETE networks in RDF
17:30:13 <ubu> .
17:30:15 <phenny> ubu: 05:27Z <kasei> tell ubu a new version of RDF::Query has hit the main CPAN server. you can now call: $query->execute( $dbh, model => 'model name' );
17:33:03 <kasei> heya ubu
17:33:11 <ubu> howdy
17:33:38 <kasei> what database are you hoping to uses this code on?
17:33:55 <ubu> Pg
17:34:09 <kasei> my postgresql/redland installation is broken at the moment, and i'm worried i may be committing mysql-specific stuff without realizing it...
17:34:22 <kasei> so let me know if it's all broken :)
17:34:29 <ubu> k :-)
17:34:34 <kasei> and if you've got thoughts on making the sql better, i'm all ears.
17:35:22 <ubu> btw, NachoMan and i had a late-night doc-hack last night and should have a worthy RDF::Helper out on CPAN probably this weekend
17:35:26 <ubu> will do
17:35:32 <kasei> great!
17:36:35 <ubu> hmmm, she no workie
17:38:05 <ubu> http://paste.husk.org/6159
17:38:11 <dc_swig> B: http://paste.husk.org/6159 from ubu
17:38:56 <ubu> ack, i forget there was a Chumpbot here
17:39:19 <giovannit> giovannit has quit
17:41:32 <kasei> can you add a warn($sql) to RDF::Query::execute() just before the prepare(), and send it to me?
17:42:00 <danbri> kasei, is the new version installable without lib-www? (or whatever that C library was)?
17:42:57 <kasei> i believe it should be, but had to jump through some hoops to try to test that.

17:48:18 <kasei> ubu: i assume that paste was missing the constructor method name? also, i'm not sure that using $! in that example will do what you expect. better to use RDF::Query->error
17:48:30 <ubu> right
17:49:14 <ubu> and yeah, i switched from new Package to Package->new (pet peeve :-)
17:49:45 <valmont> valmont has joined #swig

20:56:46 <nym> hello
20:59:07 <JibberJim> nym!
21:00:19 <nym> JibberJim!
21:00:27 <nym> i drank the kool-aid
21:00:55 <nym> i have this huge table that looks like this:
21:01:42 <nym> id, car_trim_id, att_name, att_id
21:01:56 <nym> for some crazy reason i think i can turn that into rdf
21:02:06 <nym> and somehow make it easier to query
21:02:38 <nym> not that I don't love subqueries in SQL
21:02:44 <nym> speed isn't an issue
21:02:48 <ldodds> using one of the mapping tools you can probably expose that as RDF directly
21:02:59 <nym> hmm
21:03:20 <ldodds> SquirrelRDF and D2R offer SQL->RDF, with SPARQL on top
21:03:48 <nym> is that better in any way than pushing the table into redland and using rdfobj to get it out?
21:04:01 <nym>  369055 rows btw
21:04:30 <ldodds> not "better" just different. Useful approach if you've got a bunch of other tools/apps working on the relational db already
21:07:00 <yosi_s> yosi_s has quit
21:08:25 <nym> hmm
21:08:41 <nym> i like the syntax for rdfobj

21:11:10 <sbp> no red ones in America
21:11:22 <JibberJim> nym might've been in a zoo
21:11:24 <JibberJim> or on a visit
21:11:37 <nym> brown one
21:11:46 <JibberJim> where was this?
21:11:49 <nym> it was very scarry
21:12:06 <nym> plus i hear there's someone who is reanimating dead squirrels
21:12:11 <JibberJim> it was scarred?  you've got to watch out with those probably been  in a lot of fights
21:12:20 <nym> it was in LA
21:12:30 <JibberJim> and it was brown?
21:12:30 <ldodds_> reanimating squirrels?
21:12:40 <JibberJim> are you sure it was a squirrel, and not a rat?

00:46:21 <nym> hey, can anyone recommend a really good intro to owl?
00:46:35 <nym> i want to generate an ontology from a preexisting database
00:46:40 <nym> it has key value pairs
00:46:47 <nym> and object id
00:46:48 <nym> s
00:49:30 <danbri>  nym, there's a protege tutorial around somewhere (a giant pdf of some slides?) which has good coverage of OWL
00:49:37 <danbri> sorry to be vague!
00:49:40 <nym> heh
00:50:15 <nym> is there anything clever for moving a dataset that looks like rdf (id, name, value) into redland?
00:50:29 <nym> and making the ontology for it too
00:54:45 <danbri> where's the dataset at the moment? sql?
00:55:01 <danbri> have a look around http://esw.w3.org/topic/RdfAndSql

16:55:08 <chimezie> it may not be expressive enough for the domain you are modelling with OWL
16:55:17 <chimezie> given it's specific limitations
16:55:39 <nym> right now i don't care about datatypes though
16:55:45 <rreck> or a tool you want to use doesnt support it
16:55:59 <nym> in my domain everything is pegged to an object_id
16:56:17 <nym> creating ontologies seems like the really tricky part
16:56:29 <nym> i'm downloading semanticworks, hopefully that will make this easier

18:46:59 <nym> can someone explain the differences between "range of" and "domain of" in swoop/owl?
18:48:17 <nym> actually i'm not sure if that's owl or rdfs
18:48:44 <chimezie> rdfs
18:48:53 <chimezie> "rdfs:domain of a rdf:property declares the class of the subject in a triple using this property as predicate."
18:48:55 <nym> yeah
18:49:01 <chimezie> "rdfs:range of a rdf:property declares the class or datatype of the object in a triple using this property as predicate."
18:49:03 <chimezie> if that helps
18:50:07 <nym> hmm
18:57:35 <nym> when a property describes a class, it's in the class's domain?
18:57:54 <nym> my case is i have makes, models, and trims
18:58:12 <nym> make is a superclass of model, and model a superclass of trim
18:58:27 <nym> and acceleration is a property of trim
18:58:42 <nym> i belive that is part of the domain then
18:59:18 <nym> unfortunately i have 296 properties like that
18:59:52 <nym> acceleration, accessories, activeSuspension, adjustablePedals, airConditioning, airFiltration, antennaType, ...
18:59:59 <nym> i could be doing this all day
19:00:21 <nym> but i do have three down
19:00:28 <nym> just trying to figure out if the domain part is right
19:00:50 <leobard> leobard has joined #swig
19:00:50 <chimezie> if acceleration is only used with trims, then it's domain is trim
19:01:35 <chimezie> if it can be used with either model or trim then it's domain can be make or model (i.e., high enough in the class hierarchy to accomodate all the possible domains)
19:02:14 <nym> makes sense
19:02:38 <nym> okay so a property might be isHybrid
19:03:09 <valmont> valmont has joined #swig
19:03:16 <nym> which is trim specific because a Ford Escape (Make:Ford, Model:Escape), comes in both hybrid and non hybrid trims
19:03:36 <nym> ok i got it
19:03:39 <nym> thank you chimezie
19:03:41 <nym> big help
19:03:56 <chimezie> NP
19:04:58 <nym> i just wanted to make sure i wasn't off base since i have to add so much

13:46:27 <DanC> eikeon, in rdflib, can you use the same graph in different stores?
13:46:30 <DanC> (does rdflib have stores?)"
13:47:01 <DanC> ooh... you have rdflib set up with cia? http://cia.navi.cx/stats/project/rdflib
13:50:39 <chimezie> DanC: It abstracts stores with the rdflib.store.Store interface - for which there are a few implementations. The store is the actual persistence mechanism, so you'd have to parse the same graph into different stores
13:51:13 <DanC> * DanC takes that as a 'no' answer
13:51:33 <DanC> what store do you get if you just say: store = Graph()
13:52:07 <chimezie> IOMemory, by default
13:52:52 <DanC> * DanC tries to confirm from docs...
13:53:07 <DanC> docs say "The constructor accepts one argument, the 'store'
13:53:08 <DanC> that will be used to store the graph data"
13:54:02 <DanC> * DanC would like to see doctests in the rdflib api docs
13:54:15 <chimezie> yes the constructor takes a Store instance or the name of store to use (the registered name: Sleepycat, IOMemory, MySQL, etc..)
13:54:35 <chimezie> yeah doctests would kill two birds with one stone
13:54:47 <DanC> [[
13:54:48 <DanC> predicates(self, subject=None, object=None)
13:54:48 <DanC> A generator of predicates with the given subject and object.
13:54:48 <DanC> ]]
13:55:04 <DanC> that doesn't say what sort of subject/object to pass in
13:55:39 <DanC> docs for triples and triple_choices doesn't say how they're different at all
13:56:32 <DanC> * DanC wonders what "context" means in ConjunctiveGraph
13:56:43 <chimezie> triple_choices takes a list of terms per slot instead of a single term:  graph.triple_choices((None,[FOAF.knows,FOAF.homePage],None))
13:57:35 <DanC> how does RDFTerm relate to Node? (I guess the docs I'm looking at pre-date the recent RDFTerm commits)
13:57:47 <timbl> timbl has joined #swig
13:58:05 <DanC> wierd... BNode is subclass of Identifier?
13:58:18 <chimezie> Yes the generated docs are quite out of date.

14:07:05 <shellac> I'll try to find them
14:07:06 <chimezie> all the literature I've searched use very inaccessible notation (KIF, arbitrary FOL notation, etc..)
14:07:10 <chimezie> thanks
14:08:03 <EliasT> shellac, did you read this: http://www.thefigtrees.net/lee/blog/2006/07/im_a_sparql_junkie.html ?
14:08:17 <shellac> try: http://jena.cvs.sourceforge.net/jena/jena2/etc/
14:08:28 <shellac> hi EliasT
14:08:43 <shellac> yes, I did. did it work ok?
14:08:48 <EliasT> morning (here) shellac.
14:08:48 <chimezie> oo.. jackpot!
14:09:30 <EliasT> yes, flawlessly. The only thing we were curious (did not have time) was following references. i.e. my record has a pointer (with full DN) to worklocation. Is that supported?
14:09:44 <chimezie> though there are quite a few of them.. what I was hoping for was for SHOF or SHIN subset.. but this should be better starting point than 'An Axiomatic Semantics for RDF/RDF-S, and DAML+OIL'
14:10:42 <shellac> chimezie: yes. might be worth pinging Dave Reynolds about them if you want details
14:10:57 <chimezie> will do, thanks again
14:11:08 <shellac> hmm, I hope these are the right ones. they look quite old
14:11:23 <shellac> EliasT: that is supported
14:11:31 <monkeyiq> monkeyiq has quit
14:11:42 <EliasT> k. cool. I believe I saw a ObjectProperty. is that it?
14:11:49 <chimezie> they seem 'complete' at first look.  at least the OWL lite subset (owl.rules)
14:12:09 <shellac> lmap:ObjectProperty
14:12:27 <chimezie> "This rule set is design to implement owl(f)lite using pure forward chaining"
14:13:57 <shellac> EliasT: the nasty limitation currently is the mapping back to rdf results, particularly multiple valued attributes
14:14:23 <shellac> I'll have to get back to them at some point

16:04:57 <MarkB> I designed and implemented a binary envelope for HTTP using RDF triples
16:05:13 <MarkB> Sort of like SOAP minus all the RPC baggage
16:05:25 <MarkB> Used it over satellite
16:06:18 <Wikier> Wikier has joined #swig
16:07:20 <MarkB> come to think of it, it was actually more like Atom than SOAP
16:07:38 <bblfish> ah. sounds intriguing.
16:08:10 <MarkB> twas very cool, yes
16:08:18 <MarkB> supported multiplexed streams
16:08:49 <MarkB> one stream was used for tokens, and other streams could reference those tokens
16:09:04 <bblfish> would it work over http?
16:09:06 <MarkB> you could tweak how often the tokens were resent too
16:09:08 <stain> stain has quit
16:09:08 <MarkB> yup
16:09:28 <bblfish> do you have a reference to it?
16:09:33 <MarkB> went over udp (with implicit POST semantics) mostly - satellite link anyhow
16:09:47 <MarkB> nope, wasn't able to publish it
16:09:53 <bblfish> oh pitty
16:09:57 <MarkB> but it's the protocol behind this;
16:10:23 <MarkB>  http://www.nanometrics.ca/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=123&Itemid=103
16:15:36 <darobin> this sounds a bit like FLUTE, but maybe I'm missing something
16:16:08 <MarkB> yah, there's some overlap
16:16:13 <bblfish> flute?
16:16:41 <darobin> RFC 3926
16:17:28 <darobin> it has interesting applications, like broadcasting a complete web site and the such
16:17:45 <MarkB> our protocol was unicast, but quite similar otherwise
16:18:03 <MarkB> * MarkB chokes on his lunch reading "IP multicast
16:18:06 <MarkB>    is inherently massively scalable"
16:18:13 <darobin> :)
16:19:38 <darobin> I think there are people using FLUTE in unicast as well these days, not sure
16:19:51 <darobin> basically as a form of packaging format
16:19:55 <MarkB> don't hear too much about it
16:20:20 <darobin> I hear about it all the time, but then I work in broadcast and we sell an implementation, so I would :)
16:20:35 <MarkB> ah
16:20:55 <darobin> it's used a lot in mobile TV
16:21:24 <dajobe> you mean TV over cellphone/mobile phones
16:21:27 <EliasT> * EliasT hopes he can chat with MarkB about cookies and REST one of these days.
16:21:30 <dajobe> as tv is pretty mobile on it's ownj
16:21:33 <darobin> yup
16:21:39 <darobin> and PDAs
16:21:57 <darobin> depends on your tv :)
16:23:03 <darobin> and digital tv (of the type not intended for mobile consumption) tends not to be, unless you want to be dragging a small cartful of batteries around with you :)
16:24:16 <dajobe> I guess I just don't want tv on a 5" screen that costs lots of $??s

16:27:29 <Pierce> Pierce has quit
16:27:29 <bblfish> well I am getting tired with all this artificial complexity that everyone is building up by not doing RDF
16:28:14 <MarkB> Atom doesn't really buy you that much though; there's lots of room left for RDF to add value
16:28:45 <bblfish> Well in fact as it is going it is going to give you less than the metaweblog api
16:29:05 <kpreid> kpreid has joined #swig
16:29:36 <bblfish> they can't do syncronisation (or I'd have to fight tooth and nail to get it) and listing categories is not done (but they want to finsish the spec today)
16:30:01 <bblfish> All of that because they have to work their way around xml
16:30:14 <bblfish> which means it takes a lot longer to find a solution
16:31:17 <bblfish> And the main reason they want xml, is because they want to use xml as the new table format: so that their XPath and XQuery tools can work with them
16:31:53 <bblfish> So really what is needed is an xml crystallisation format of rdf
16:32:05 <deep2> deep2 has quit
16:32:23 <bblfish> there has to be a simple way to take an ontology and say christalise it into such and such a tree
16:33:03 <bblfish> then the xml database people will be able to work with the rigid structures they need for their tools to work.
16:34:02 <bblfish> Until that happens they will *always* be against rdf. Cause "if all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail"
16:34:28 <chimezie> you really can't 'normalize' RDF semantics into XML in a general / uniform way.  You have a better chance at a uniform XML dialect for representing RDF, but not a semantic mapping
16:34:54 <ldodds> ldodds has left #swig
16:35:22 <bblfish> well someone has to put up a list of what is not possible and why
16:36:27 <perigrin> Its not really a problem of limitations but that semantically equivalent statements can have different serializations no?
16:37:12 <peacekeeper> peacekeeper has quit
16:37:27 <chimezie> the issue is both data structure impedance (tree vs graph), non-uniform representation of the same semantics (as you mention), as well XML not being suited for KR in the first place
16:37:46 <bblfish> what is needed is: 1. Given an ontology such as atom-owl http://bblfish.net/work/atom-owl/2006-06-06/ and its vocab
16:38:00 <bblfish> 2. A Relax-NG to constrain the tree
16:38:24 <bblfish> A way to interpret such a tree by looking at the ontology definitions
16:39:32 <perigrin> KR?
16:39:35 <bblfish> so that an interpreter could look at say <title>my first entry</title> find out that title is a relation between an :Entry and a xsd:string  from the ontology, and so discover that that means [ :title "my first entry" ].
16:39:45 <chimezie> knowledge representation
16:39:50 <perigrin> ahh
16:40:38 <cygri> cygri has quit
16:40:40 <bblfish> The Relax NG would help the xml database people, the ontology would make it easy to build new formats and stop wasting time inventing vocabs.
16:40:45 <lkagal> lkagal has quit
16:40:59 <bblfish> as well as provide a semantics for the xml
16:41:43 <bblfish> Well if I had one million $ to give away, I think that would be worth placing it there
16:41:50 <lkagal> lkagal has joined #swig
16:42:12 <darobin> dajobe: I wouldn't want tv even on a 50" screen... yet it would appear that folks like it, and that pays for the work I'm doing so I'm not complaining :)

16:43:32 <beobal> beobal has quit
16:43:50 <darobin> perigrin: :)
16:44:39 <darobin> bblfish: I guess you could decorate a RelaxNG in such a way that it could be converted to XSLT that would GRRRRDDDDL stuff out of instances
16:44:50 <darobin> it might not even be horridly hard
16:45:00 <bblfish> I know I have done that with atom-owl mentioned above
16:45:10 <bblfish> atom->atom-owl grddl
16:45:21 <darobin> based on RNG in the middle?
16:45:52 <darobin> that being said I don't think that many of the XML DB folks will be happy with RNG, they tend to prefer WXS
16:46:10 <bblfish> ah?
16:46:20 <darobin> in my experience that is
16:46:34 <darobin> XQuery only takes advantage of WXS, not RNG
16:46:41 <bblfish> oh
16:46:46 <darobin> yeah, it's a shame
16:47:07 <darobin> but I guess formal semantics that would cover both would be hard to come up with
16:47:34 <dajobe> that's the ISO DSDL work IIRC
16:47:52 <darobin> I doubt they're coming up with formal semantics covering both
16:48:20 <darobin> DSDL can tie in WXS processing (e.g. in NVDL) but not much more than that
16:48:38 <bblfish> phew why are things so complicated...
16:48:42 <dajobe> the xml scheme type system is the hook that probably could be used to link xml syntax to semantics
16:49:06 <darobin> bblfish: because we'd be out of a job if they weren't? :-p
16:49:31 <bblfish> darobin: life is complicated enough, we will never be out of a job :-/
16:49:38 <farh0rizon> farh0rizon has quit
16:49:52 <darobin> dajobe: I doubt it. It's not very flexible, you'd get limited semantics out of that
16:49:54 <perigrin> * perigrin wouldn't be out of a job, sadly it barely touches XML these days.
16:50:08 <danja> danja has quit
16:50:51 <darobin> bblfish: you do have a point there
16:54:39 <bblfish> darobin: well I am thinking more of relaxNG as a constrain on the tree
16:54:45 <bblfish> constrains
16:54:49 <bblfish> constraint
16:55:31 <darobin> sure, I was just thinking that it could be convenient to specify them together
16:55:40 <darobin> if only to make sure that they stay in synch
16:56:21 <bblfish> Well I don't think one wants to specify them together, really. Because as we know there are many ways of serialising a graph to a tree
16:56:41 <bblfish> The ontology would be pure rdf as it is now. No problem.
16:56:41 <darobin> yes, I'm just thinking of the XML -> RDF case, not the reverse

16:58:20 <bengee> bengee has quit
16:58:55 <darobin> I think NachoAway was working on something called XRLT that would do GRRRDDDL in reverse, could be useful here esp. if it can guarantee that you get the same tree out of the same model
16:59:04 <darobin> * darobin hugs his XML
16:59:05 <bblfish> (as I say though, that can't be done because powerful xml databases are coming online, and people will not be able to help themselves wanting to use them)
16:59:39 <bblfish> ah that's also interesting
17:00:46 <darobin> yeah, it's a lot easier to create tools that can map one to the other in a way that's useful for the consumer than to convince people to drop something they're using :)

17:27:47 <NachoMan> I have a "xrtlproc" command-line script in the parent directory, along with a "lib" directory with the associated parser

17:28:51 <darobin> * darobin has to go, bye
17:28:58 <NachoMan> * NachoMan too soon
17:29:24 <bblfish> NachoMan: a good test case would be to see if you can take atom, convert them through atom-owl to rdf, and then back to atom
17:30:19 <NachoMan> bblfish: right now I think a good test case would be to get the parser to comply with the full spec that I've worked up first. :-)
17:30:29 <NachoMan> I think I've only got 75% of the spec covered
17:30:31 <bblfish> ah ok :-)
17:30:48 <bblfish> would it be able to do that, when ready?
17:31:22 <NachoMan> Well, I've been too busy building stuff with RDF to keep up on the various specs out there, so I'm not familiar with atom-owl
17:31:46 <NachoMan> but, if atom data is converted to an RDF graph, then yeah, XRTL shouldn't have any problem converting it right back again.

17:47:50 <bblfish> heh
17:48:01 <bblfish> * bblfish one more rdf bookmark
17:48:24 <NachoMan> Its concept of datasources are really neat; especially their "Composite" datasource.  I wish there was similar support in Redland
17:49:01 <NachoMan> but Mozilla decided to go with RDF prior to the official release.  So Mozilla is built on a draft RDF spec that's incompatible with the real-world.
17:49:23 <bblfish> are they going to update?
17:50:19 <NachoMan> there's been talk for the past 2 years about doing that.  In the next few releases their plan is to move to a more centralized storage model, based on SQLite
17:50:34 <bblfish> oh pitty
17:50:48 <NachoMan> Right now RDF is used for bookmarks, history, preferences, package and extension identification, installation info, etc.
17:50:50 <bblfish> rdf would seem so much better
17:51:18 <NachoMan> yeah.  When I was last involved in the Mozilla community, they were talking about layering RDF on top of the existing model, but I'm not sure what came of that.
17:51:50 <dajobe> some of redland's design was based on ideas from mozilla's rdf interfaces
17:51:56 <ronwalf> ronwalf has joined #swig
17:51:57 <NachoMan> Oh, and RDF right now is used to expose LDAP, POP, IMAP and local folders for mail handling.  It's really quite neat
17:52:18 <NachoMan> dajobe: Ooh, cool.  No wonder I made the transition easily. :-D
17:52:33 <dajobe> the sources/targets/arcs naming is the most obvious one
17:53:03 <NachoMan> dajobe: Any idea if it would be possible to implement virtual or composite datasources in Redland?
17:53:20 <dajobe> of course it's possible, it's on the TODO list
17:53:32 <dajobe> never seemed urgent enough to actually DO
17:54:27 <NachoMan> right.  I used both of them quite a bit in the Mozilla world, and they're the two features I miss most in Redland.

18:02:58 <bblfish> am I correct in thinking that all rdf data can be served with application/xml+rdf ?
18:03:16 <dajobe> rdf+xml
18:03:21 <bblfish> yep
18:03:24 <dajobe> s/can/should/
18:04:11 <bblfish> ok because that's what I argued here:
18:04:14 <bblfish>  http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg05678.html
18:05:06 <bblfish> the xml people seem to be needing more and more mime types

18:10:05 <beobal> beobal has joined #swig
18:10:24 <dajobe> well that's because all xml docs have potentially different data models [syntax models]
18:10:30 <bblfish> exactly
18:10:32 <bblfish> :-)
18:10:37 <bblfish> kindof a problem no?
18:10:37 <EliasT> EliasT has left #swig
18:11:06 <dajobe> unless you use something else to distinguish them such as the namespace of the root document (maybe you could read xml namespacs spec to read it that way) or use xsi:schemaLocation
18:11:16 <dajobe> but people want to do that before fetching it
18:11:44 <dajobe> that way ends up with the feed: unregistered URI scheme pit of problems
18:12:08 <dajobe> nuts, as you'd have to check the document was a feed anyway...
18:12:19 <dajobe> </rant>
18:12:26 <dajobe> * dajobe goes to tend to work things
18:12:28 <bblfish> yes. That's the big problem with xml. They pretend it is a universal format, whereas in fact no body knows how to interpret them
18:12:41 <bblfish> * bblfish yes this is endless rant territory
18:12:48 <dajobe> (well they know a little how to interpret them, the xml specs say that)
18:12:50 <dajobe> * dajobe really goes

15:45:50 <sheets> rdf/xml literals have have xml:lang and rdf:datatype attributes: what's the default value for these? The spec says that the empty string MAY be specified. Does this mean that the data vendor MAY specify it or the parser vendor MAY specify it?
15:48:00 <sheets> Perhaps more importantly, what is the default value if these attributes are not specified? Empty string or null?
15:48:43 <shellac> you can have either a lang, or a datatype
15:48:52 <shellac> there is no default
15:49:37 <sheets> is xml:lang="" or rdf:datatype="" different from not specifying either?
15:49:42 <shellac> not sure what the empty string could mean, other than no value
15:51:07 <shellac> ah

15:53:03 <sheets> but is that what the spec really means? should I treat the validator as golden?
15:53:15 <shellac> that's what I'm wondering
15:53:39 <sheets> I will go poke someone spec-related and get back to you. Thanks.
15:54:45 <shellac> ok, found it
15:54:48 <shellac> "The xml:lang="" form indicates the absence of a language identifier."
15:55:09 <shellac> (http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-languages)
15:55:33 <shellac> and from http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-datatyped-literals
15:56:38 <shellac> "Any RDF URI reference can be used in the attribute"
15:57:30 <shellac> so "" is base, just like rdf:about=""
16:01:29 <sheets> Ok... from what I understand now, you are correct that rdf:datatype should always be a URI or be null whereas xml:lang should always be the empty string or a language identifier.
16:01:50 <sheets> The defaults are null and "" respectively
16:02:23 <sheets> shellac, is this what you understand?
16:03:08 <nmg> nmg has quit
16:03:49 <shellac> I'm not sure what you mean by null there
16:05:12 <shellac> if you're asking about defaults in the XML sense you may be right
16:05:30 <sheets> meaning there is no value for rdf:datatype, as far as parsers and friends are concerned it doesn't exist and shouldn't be mentioned
16:05:51 <sheets> defaults in the XML sense?
16:06:33 <shellac> ah, yes. no value. but default is no value for both datatype and lang
16:06:58 <sheets> but "no value" for lang is ""
16:07:51 <shellac> yep
16:08:41 <shellac> strictly, I suppose, 'no value' can be expressed as the empty string for lang, but not for datatype

18:13:26 <chimezie> eyecandy++
18:14:50 <iv> is there a set of links to sites that were built with Jena?
18:14:53 <sheets> * sheets will blog about backend soon... we're announcing later this week.
18:15:00 <iv> theres 3 million for rails, and i can even finda  dozen seaside sites, but none Jena
18:16:09 <chimezie> .g ieee intelligent systems
18:16:13 <phenny> chimezie: http://www.computer.org/intelligent
18:16:41 <iv> more generally. how come 99% of semantic-web apps, even the offline stuff like protege/ is writte in JAVA? i dont even have a JVM now that rtorrent supports DHT
18:17:04 <iv> * iv continues with rails frontend to triplestore via redland
18:17:43 <perigrin> iv: I know of a few apps in Perl, and a lot in Python ... live in the glorious 1%
18:17:51 <chimezie> Java simply has more exposure / mindshare, I'd think
18:18:03 <iv> im not complaining, it jsut seems a weird distribution. youd think the kind of people into semantic stuff would also be into smalltalk, haskell, etc
18:18:10 <chimezie> * chimezie too is a 1%er
18:18:30 <perigrin> iv: I think Java had a lion share of XML parsers at the right time.
18:19:03 <perigrin> That said ... redland, rdflib, RDF::Core ...
18:19:13 <perigrin> :)
18:19:14 <iv> yeh. theres plenty to get me started :)
18:19:19 <chimezie> well semantic apps are language-agnostic, so it's more a matter of familiarity with one language/technology stack over another
18:19:37 <iv> im a bit surprised thuogh, i mean i did a 'locate rdf' on my hd, and despite having ~700 programs installed in gentoo, only 2 actualy have RDF files: firefox, and lv2
18:19:58 <iv> yet, theres trillions of app-specific flat-text formats
18:20:21 <danja> iv, my blog's backed by Jena
18:20:55 <perigrin> * perigrin considers backing his with Redland ... 
18:20:56 <danja> chimezie, I hit a little RDFLib/SPARQL issue earlier
18:21:19 <danja> ampersand not escaped in XML results
18:21:52 <perigrin> iv: that's a mindshare problem ...
18:22:06 <chimezie> ahh.. thx, danja - will address that
18:22:23 <perigrin> it's quicker/easier to hack something out in CSV|YAML|CustomXML|INI format than to think about what you want to say in RDF.
18:22:42 <danja> see http://dannyayers.com/2006/07/11/hevents-to-timeline
18:22:52 <danja> (chime)
18:23:20 <danja> chimezie, also - has OPTIONAL been implemented?
18:23:33 <chimezie> yes, with a few caveats:
18:23:42 <danja> it looked like it parsed ok then went into an infinite loop...
18:24:05 <chimezie> 1) nested OPTIONALs not supported 2) outer filters that refer variables within OPTIONALs are not supported
18:24:18 <chimezie> can you isolate a usecase, I can reproduce?
18:24:27 <danja> yep
18:24:30 <chimezie> sweet
18:25:06 <danja> er, where shall I put it?
18:25:49 <chimezie> email me or http://rafb.net/paste/
18:25:58 <danja> ok
18:26:25 <danja> actually if you try the py linked from above, I think every OPTIONAL I tried on it hung
18:27:14 <chimezie> hmm.. last time I tried, I was able to get through the OPTIONAL test cases in the DAWG test suite.. i'll go with the py
18:30:39 <danja> ok, I've mailed you data+query, gmail
18:30:56 <chimezie> thanks
18:31:00 <eikeon_> chimezie: would you like me to migrate QueryResult's xml output code to use the XMLWriter code in rdflib/syntax/serializers/
18:31:45 <chimezie> sure.. meanwhile I'll see if I can reproduce the OPTIONAL hang

14:31:12 <dajobe> some kind of schema  (property, class) lookup that's better than '.g terms'

14:31:39 <chimezie> ontology 'registries' perhaps
14:32:51 <chimezie> authentication / identification by foaf:name
14:32:53 <DanC> I'm working on a bibliography microformat, and I'd like to say "this is the list of authors". dc:creator doesn't work that way, does it?
14:33:49 <DanC> does foaf have a way to say "these are the members of this group, and there are no others"?
14:33:50 <chimezie> i think so

14:35:20 <chimezie> i was under the impression that dc:creator was pretty open ended, as is foaf:maker
14:35:57 <DanC> open ended meaning
14:36:02 <chimezie> maybe an owl:oneOf enumeration would be more explicit
14:36:29 <DanC> foaf:membershipClass + owl:oneOf will let me say what I mean. sort of a mouthful, though. hmm.
14:37:05 <dajobe> there's a new draft: http://dublincore.org/documents/2006/05/29/dc-rdf-notes/
14:37:17 <dajobe> but I don't see list of authors there or recall it being discussed
14:37:47 <DanC> dcrdf:valuestring ? rdf:value wasn't good enough?
14:38:01 <dajobe> i didn't get that either
14:38:13 <dajobe> report: http://dublincore.org/architecturewiki/DCRDFTaskforce/PublicCommentJune2006
14:38:33 <DanC> "The use of rdfs:label or rdf:value for expressing value strings is no longer supported, as their original definitions do not clearly fit this purpose. " ?!
14:38:36 <dajobe> they propose to go back to rdf:value
14:38:46 <EliasT> speaking of rdf:value ....  http://groups.google.com/group/atom-owl/browse_thread/thread/eb1df16cb1a653c7/6d4dac3693eb855f#6d4dac3693eb855f
14:39:06 <EliasT> can somebody swapped in Atom/OWL double-check this use of rdf:value (iand maybe)
14:39:08 <dajobe> * dajobe -> do rdf at work / spend all day at meetings (pick 1)
14:39:17 <EliasT> do rdf at work
14:39:33 <chimezie> is that a trick question ? :)
14:39:54 <DanC> which use, EliasT ? I'm sorta suffering pronoun overload in that groups.google msg
14:40:18 <EliasT> [] :id [
14:40:18 <EliasT>     rdf:value "urn:lsid:ex.org:entries:1"^^xsd:anyURI
14:40:18 <EliasT>     x:identifierType "lsid" ;
14:40:18 <EliasT>     random:property  "randomValue" .
14:40:18 <EliasT> ] .
14:40:31 <EliasT> <a:id xmlns:x="urn:bar"
14:40:31 <EliasT> x:identifierType="lsid">urn:lsid:ex.org:entries:1</a>
14:40:31 <DanC> what's the range of :id ?
14:40:36 <iand> dajobe, do rdf in meetings all day
14:40:38 <chimezie> uh oh.. lsid's
14:40:43 <chimezie> with anyUri datatype
14:41:29 <chimezie> looks like an appropriate use of rdf:value to me
14:41:32 <EliasT> isn't URN subclass of URI?
14:41:51 <chimezie> * chimezie believes so
14:41:52 <DanC> EliasT, what's the range of :id
14:42:00 <DanC> ?
14:42:04 <EliasT> at this moment is typed literal
14:42:15 <EliasT> but because we need to hang attributes (from the xml world)
14:42:23 <EliasT> I'm proposing it uses a bnode
14:42:33 <EliasT> * EliasT forgot to reference DesignIssue/InterpretationProperties
14:42:34 <chimezie> "structured values"
14:42:56 <EliasT> right, that's why started using it. but we were just reading the manual.
14:43:08 <EliasT> wondering if anything has changed or better practices have arised.
14:43:10 <chimezie> but dont' the attributes you are hanging off have mostly to do with things lsid can capture by itself?
14:43:11 <DanC> I don't see anything appropriate about that whole scenario. What the heck is it trying to say?
14:43:41 <EliasT> <a:id xmlns:x="urn:bar"
14:43:41 <EliasT> x:identifierType="lsid">urn:lsid:ex.org:entries:1</a>
14:43:53 <EliasT> has extraneous xml attributes
14:43:59 <chimezie> whats randomProperty?
14:44:04 <DanC> can you make an english sentence out of it?
14:44:07 <chimezie> that an LSID construct of some kind?
14:44:22 <chimezie> oh..
14:44:39 <EliasT> * EliasT has trouble with english sentences.
14:44:40 <chimezie> 'there is a thing with an LSID identifier of ...'
14:45:05 <EliasT> Atom extension developers can add any attributes using their own namespace to any element in the Atom XML document.
14:45:21 <DanC> the question is too abstract for me. It's like asking whether f(x) is an appropriate use of x. well, maybe, for some f's.
14:45:32 <EliasT> I'm trying.
14:46:17 <DanC> I think trying to do a blind (general purpose) mapping of extension elements from atom to RDF isn't likely to be useful.
14:46:21 <chimezie> what things are (typically) added to / hung off of  identifiers?
14:46:22 <EliasT> Now, we must/should bring some of those attributes in to our RDF model and it's hard for elements that don't have a resource to hange properties from.
14:46:56 <EliasT> you are correct, but since I'm building an Atom RDF store, I must.
14:47:06 <fidothe> fidothe has joined #swig
14:47:30 <chimezie> perhaps only a subset of the Atom XML source should be reflected in RDF
14:47:39 <chimezie> some 'controlled' subset
14:47:52 <DanC> folks that write atom extensions should write GRDDL transforms for them, perhaps.
14:48:12 <chimezie> yup
14:48:27 <EliasT> I agree with all that...
14:48:33 <EliasT> but I still need to store it
14:48:44 <EliasT> unless I store this: [] rdf:value "entire xml" .
14:48:45 <DanC> this lsid use case isn't very motivating. You can just throw away x:identifierType="lsid" without losing any information.
14:48:48 <chimezie> RDF is your intended primary store?
14:48:53 <EliasT> yes
14:49:08 <DanC> yes, store the "
14:49:18 <DanC> yes, store the "entire atom/xml" in the case of extension attributes.
14:49:22 <chimezie> that may be the real  issue if your intent is to lose nothing from vanilla Atom XML
14:49:33 <Kriegel> Kriegel has quit
14:49:34 <EliasT> <a:link rel="replies" href="foo" thr:count="10" xmlns:thr="urn:foo" />
14:49:54 <DanC> the last time I got into a discussion of the semantics of atom:id, I had henry story and timbl telling me that the Atom spec doesn't mean what it plainly says.
14:50:00 <EliasT> DanC how do I do that for attributes?
14:50:23 <schepers> schepers has quit
14:50:30 <EliasT> how do I store the xml of attributes for an element whose RDF representation is a triple with a literal object?
14:50:55 <EliasT> [] atom:id "anyidentifieryouwant" .
14:50:57 <DanC> no... store the _whole atom entry_ element (or feed, if necessary).
14:51:06 <chimezie> there is too much of an impedance between the representation formats to do it in a fully automated way

14:54:25 <chimezie> hehe
14:54:35 <DanC> your problem is that the Atom community didn't agree to the RDF semantics; so you're fighting a losing battle when you try to map Atom (including extensions) 1-1 to RDF.
14:55:10 <EliasT> The same battle we fight with HTML, Microformats, XML.
14:55:10 <DanC> * DanC is more and more convinced that RSS/RDF is worth saving
14:55:24 <chimezie> qed
14:55:25 <EliasT> This is our game.

14:56:13 <EliasT> My comment was for yours: your problem is that the Atom community didn't agree to the RDF semantics; so you're fighting a losing battle when you try to map Atom (including extensions) 1-1 to RDF.
14:56:17 <EliasT> not round-tripping
14:56:29 <EliasT> but working with formats that were not originally defined using RDF/OWL.
14:56:35 <DanC> 1-1 is what you need for round-tripping.
14:57:00 <EliasT> round-tripping is optional.
14:57:05 <EliasT> 1-1 is for completeness.

15:46:41 <CaptSolo> i think we need to get semweb data out there
15:46:46 <CaptSolo> (in any and all of formats)
15:47:01 <CaptSolo> danja: thanks for the data - hope you don't mind
15:47:20 <CaptSolo> you most probably noticed the period of Dec 2005 -> Feb 2006
15:47:29 <danja> er, nope...

15:48:09 <CaptSolo> where timeline almost can't handle the volume of the posts :)
15:48:24 <CaptSolo> thanks to one man i am talking to now
15:48:35 <danja> cool icon!
15:48:39 <CaptSolo> hehe
15:48:50 <CaptSolo> i guess that's Sambuca

15:50:08 <CaptSolo> the left one from http://www.asemantics.com/n/events/apr-2005.html
15:50:09 <danja> when I get a bit of time (this is about 6 months overdue)
15:50:29 <danja> yep, that's her
15:50:48 <danja> Sparql's got a rounder face
15:51:07 <CaptSolo> your carrot favicon was a bit too small so i had to think of something (and as [GNU] pointed out by downsizing i decreased the information content by some 100x at the very least)
15:51:24 <CaptSolo> (still can tell it's a cat :)
15:51:32 <danja> that's plenty :-)
15:51:44 <CaptSolo> and cats can only associate with you :)
15:51:54 <danja> yeah, i want to add a sparql endpoint to the blog
15:52:13 <CaptSolo> in any case - timeline offers nice consumer of data... very nice...
15:52:17 <danja> so SIOC should presumably be available with a CONSTRUCT
15:52:25 <CaptSolo> cool :)
15:52:27 <danja> timeline, yep
15:52:43 <CaptSolo> as soon as it is available in RDF, we can map to SIOC
15:52:55 <CaptSolo> no problem there
15:53:03 <danja> the data inside is currently RSS + some vocabs of Reto's + things like FOAF
15:53:06 <CaptSolo> though SIOC data source 'd be nice
15:53:32 <CaptSolo> is the RDF data exposed to the outside?
15:53:48 <CaptSolo> i won't worry about SPARQL query itself, can always be done on the RDF store
15:53:58 <danja> not at the moment, one snag - there are plain-text email addresses in it

15:55:47 <CaptSolo> danja: is that the only obstacle about exposing RDF data?
15:55:51 <danja> but there should be RDF available for individual pages
15:56:07 <CaptSolo> can't you leave the e-mail out (do sha1 of it)
15:56:42 <CaptSolo> what's the url of RDF?
15:57:05 <danja> add .rdf to any page, or putting it in the Accept header should work
15:57:23 <danja> you get a lot of unrelated statements too
15:58:03 <CaptSolo> is there some 'Site' concept linking to all the pages?
15:58:16 <danja> er, should be
15:58:27 <CaptSolo> or main RDF page linking to all the individual post's RDF pages?
15:58:55 <CaptSolo> BTW - how do you find reading your blog posts on a timeline? :)
15:59:08 <danja> odd
15:59:11 <CaptSolo> it might even be my preferred way of exploring weblogs
15:59:21 <danja> yep, it does add something
15:59:42 <CaptSolo> and allows to go quite back in history -http://sparql.captsolo.net/timeline/origins.html

16:00:24 <danja> me too
16:00:29 <CaptSolo> was nice to see you around :)
16:00:40 <danja> btw, I'd be tempted to do a Timeline of Scoble's blog
16:00:49 <danja> for a bit of exposure
16:01:02 <CaptSolo> mmm...
16:01:07 <CaptSolo> where's his SIOC export? :)

17:10:17 <bblfish> wonder if it really should limit its domain
17:10:18 <daniel_larsson> daniel_larsson has joined #swig
17:11:10 <DanC> and range Person is too constrained too... I need something that can express an ordered list of authors.
17:12:58 <bblfish> ah, the list has to be ordered to express priority?
17:13:23 <DanC> yes. academics are like that. And I especially want to express "and there are no other authors"
17:14:07 <DanC> so that I can refer to *the* person who is one of the authors of that paper with surname Smith
17:14:22 <bblfish> ah good point...
17:14:29 <DanC> hmm... that assumes surname is functional. hmm. hmm.
17:15:38 <bblfish> that makes me wonder if in AtomOwl I am being too liberal by using :author, because I am not stating that those are all the authors, whereas perhaps that is what atom means...
17:15:39 <daniel_larsson> South Korea's team in the Soccer World Cup had 4 or 5 players named Lee... so that might be tricky in general :)
17:16:02 <danja> danja has quit
17:16:38 <DanC> having multiple persons with the same last name is no problem; I said functional, not inversefunctional. the problem with saying surname is functional is when somebody marries and takes on a different surname.

17:50:10 <DanC> .g MarcOnt
17:50:12 <phenny> DanC: http://www.marcont.org/
17:51:21 <DanC> hmm...    xmlns:bibtex="http://purl.org/net/nknouf/ns/bibtex#"
17:52:08 <CaptSolo> AFAIK MarcOnt also have a mapping engine that can convert between MarcOnt, Bibtex, MARC21, ...
17:53:03 <danja> danja has joined #swig
17:53:04 <DanC> * DanC hunts for an example
17:53:13 <CaptSolo> here it is: http://portal.marcont.org/mediations.jsp
17:54:43 <DanC> er... I was gonna feed it http://www.w3.org/2006/04/irw65/urisym.bib , but it doesn't seem to take input by reference. wild...
17:55:54 <DanC> ok... it loaded... generated bibtexml pretty well..
17:56:26 <DanC> wierd... <bibtex:Book rdf:ID='http://www.marcont.org/bibtexrdf#Kr80' >
17:56:48 <DanC> it took my bibtex keys and made wierd URIs out of them when it made RDF
17:57:17 <CaptSolo> they could probably use suggestions how to make it better
17:57:27 <CaptSolo> weird they don't take urls as input
17:57:31 <DanC> and from the department of redundancy department, it labels plain literals as xsd strings:     <bibtex:hasTitle rdf:datatype='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string' >Naming and Necessity     </bibtex:hasTitle
17:57:40 <edsu_> edsu_ is now known as edsu
17:58:01 <bengee> bengee has quit
17:58:14 <DanC> and it doesn't deal with authors versus their names...    <bibtex:hasAuthor rdf:datatype='http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string' >Kripke, Saul     </bibtex:hasAuthor >
17:58:50 <DanC> which is a big point of my excercise here... I'm trying to formalize some citations and exploit the results foaf-style, e.g. "if I wrote a paper with you, mail from you can go in my inbox without filtering"
17:59:28 <DanC> let's try the MarcOnt layer...
17:59:36 <DanC> <rdf:RDF  />
17:59:39 <DanC> :-(
17:59:42 <CaptSolo> right, identifying author only by name surname is not too good
17:59:52 <CaptSolo> it did not generate marcont :(
18:00:08 <CaptSolo> so all layers below it will also be broken
18:00:31 <DanC> so... I'm losing... is this a funded project? i.e. is it likely to be a good investment of time if I figure out how to report these issues?
18:00:58 <DanC> the demo page doesn't say how to report problems
18:01:10 <bengtf> bengtf has quit
18:01:34 <DanC> the "mailing lists" link gives a 500 java-fell-over error
18:02:02 <CaptSolo> it is made by a team in DERI
18:02:23 <CaptSolo> * CaptSolo hunts for the email address
18:03:01 <CaptSolo> e-mail for the leader of MarcOnt is sebastian.kruk@deri.org
18:03:35 <CaptSolo> i believe they are eager to receive bug reports and fix them
18:04:08 <CaptSolo> his web page: http://www.deri.ie/about/team/details/?no_cache=1&uid=66
18:04:29 <DanC> * DanC finds a 
18:04:33 <DanC> * DanC finds a "contact us"
18:04:36 <DanC> * DanC finds a "contact us" page http://www.marcont.org/index.php?option=com_contact&catid=12&Itemid=59
18:04:59 <DanC> boy... those URIs make me nervous. what's wrong with http://www.marcont.org/contact ?
18:05:07 <CaptSolo> that's the closest to work on biblio info in RDF that i know of
18:05:21 <CaptSolo> same here
18:05:23 <DanC> how do you know about it?
18:05:31 <valmont> valmont has joined #swig
18:05:56 <CaptSolo> Sebastian is my colleague, so i have witnessed what they are doing, seen some presentations and demos
18:06:03 <DanC> * DanC hunts for a path from CaptSolo to markont... finds http://captsolo.net/info/ via /whois ...
18:06:52 <CaptSolo> afraid whois info is quite outdated - i am now in Ireland most of the time (whois points to Latvia)
18:07:12 <CaptSolo> * CaptSolo wonders what methods is DanC employing in the path-hunting
18:08:01 <DanC> well, (a) following my nose via IRC /whois, and (b) letting you know what I was looking for, in case you wanted to help ;-)
18:08:17 <CaptSolo> re. markont - they have good contacts with library community, but they might benefit from comments from "hardcore RDF geeks"
18:08:23 <DanC> is there something I can read about your current work in Ireland?
18:08:56 <DanC> (in case you haven't noticed, I do a lot of homework before I start a conversation with somebody I don't know well.)
18:09:18 <DanC> (especially before sending software problem reports)
18:09:20 <CaptSolo> my current work is mainly on SIOC, not involved with MarkOnt directly
18:09:34 <CaptSolo> if you think DERI Galway in general, then there are a number of places to look
18:10:00 <shellac> shellac has joined #swig
18:10:15 <DanC> * DanC tries following nose from http://deri.org/ ... gets a flashy looking thing... is it valid? no. sigh.
18:10:30 <CaptSolo> for dynamic "feed" of SIOC progress the best thing to look at is:
18:10:34 <DanC> I'm interested in a path from http://deri.org/ to SIOC work
18:10:39 <CaptSolo>  - http://rdfs.org/sioc/
18:11:03 <CaptSolo>  - http://groups.google.com/group/sioc-dev
18:11:13 <CaptSolo> * CaptSolo looks 
18:11:36 <DanC> the http://rdfs.org/sioc/ page isn't signed. http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/SignIt
18:11:53 <DanC> oops... maybe it is...
18:12:56 <DanC> so I can get from http://rdfs.org/sioc/ to http://www.deri.ie/ ... is there a path back? perhaps via the projects list? http://www.deri.ie/research/projects/
18:13:17 <bblfish> does N3 no longer have <=> ?
18:13:35 <CaptSolo> the path from deri.org to SIOC is:
18:13:41 <CaptSolo>  - www.deri.ie
18:13:50 <CaptSolo>  -> semantic web cluster
18:13:55 <DanC> I'm not sure about the status of <=> ; in what sense did N3 formerly have it, bblfish ?
18:14:40 <DanC> sigh... http://sw.deri.ie/ opens in a new window.
18:14:48 <peepo> peepo has joined #swig
18:15:02 <CaptSolo>  -> research
18:15:20 <CaptSolo> right - been fighting with web master about things like this
18:15:41 <CaptSolo> some think it's cool (probably marketing oriented people who think you'll stay longer in site if they open in new window)
18:15:56 <DanC> pls do what you can to clue them in
18:16:03 <CaptSolo>  - http://sw.deri.ie/research
18:16:17 <DanC> yes, I'm on that research page; I see Sebastian.
18:16:21 <DanC> we're getting really close :)
18:16:23 <CaptSolo> there's a link to SIOC from John's and my (Uldis) names
18:16:45 <CaptSolo> when looking at it, the path from DERI to SIOC is really hard
18:17:03 <DanC> Uldis. Ah. ok. nice to meet you. ;-) that is: I can now connect "CaptSolo" to what I often like to know about a person.
18:17:10 <briansuda> briansuda has quit
18:17:32 <CaptSolo> but since there's less control over generic web pages we manage all info on rdfs.org/sioc - which we can change as needed
18:17:41 <CaptSolo> Nice to meet you, Dan :)
18:18:12 <CaptSolo> i know - my CaptSolo and Uldis identities might not obviously point to each other
18:18:24 <DanC> * DanC wonders where to "file" this http://sw.deri.ie/research page, since it seems to be a gold nugget
18:18:25 <CaptSolo> unless you google for 'Uldis Bojars'
18:18:43 <CaptSolo> it's a good starting point indeed
18:18:57 <DanC> ok, now, can we get from there to marcont? did you say sebastian works on it?
18:19:07 <DanC> indeed, there's the link.
18:19:10 <CaptSolo>  - and thanks for askign for the path - being inside one quite often takes things for obvious / granted
18:19:22 <DanC> ok... now I know I have some recourse if nobody answers my problem report ;-)
18:19:47 <CaptSolo> e-mail sebastian directly - that's probably the best
18:20:03 <bblfish> DanC: Oh it looks like it was only proposed at http://infomesh.net/2002/notation3/#impliessyntax
18:20:05 <CaptSolo> he might be on a vacation now, but i'd expect he checks his emails
18:20:15 <bblfish> I'll just use log:means
18:20:17 <iand> iand has joined #swig
18:20:29 <DanC> I like to keep problem reports public... I'll copy www-archive@w3.org if the marcont project doesn't provide a public archive of problem reports.
18:21:02 <DanC> yes, log:means is reasonably established. if it's not in the test suite, it should be.
18:21:03 <CaptSolo> sure
18:21:36 <DanC> how about if I just mail him a pointer to this log and copy you? that would be easiest for me. Would that be asking too much of him and you?
18:21:55 <stoni> stoni has joined #swig
18:22:22 <CaptSolo> BTw if you travelled to http://captsolo.net/info/ you'd have found FOAF auto-discovery info with my real name
18:22:37 <CaptSolo> no, not at all :)
18:23:00 <CaptSolo> and i'll file the deri research page then
18:23:01 <DanC> yes, I thought about looking for a foaf file... I don't seem to have foaf tools integrated into my workflow yet, though.

18:27:43 <CaptSolo> DanC: re. workflow - what browser are you using?
18:28:14 <DanC> Sebastian gets points for "Email a copy of this message to your own address " on his email form. http://www.marcont.org/index.php?option=com_contact&task=view&contact_id=2&Itemid=59
18:28:38 <CaptSolo> having 'metadata detectors' really helps - like FOAFer, etc...
18:29:18 <CaptSolo> at least i find it useful that SIOC detector sits in my browsers status bar - instant notification of SIOC data present and one click away to doing something with the data
18:30:47 <CaptSolo> thanks for pointers to good titles and page signing - will pass those on (and there's still a lot to learn from me as well)

05:54:57 <dajobe> I can't find anything more than that
05:55:01 <dajobe> I wonder what 'deployment' means
06:02:05 <Biblio> to make it happen, i guess
06:02:20 <dajobe> I meant specifically.
06:03:08 <Biblio> creating necessary specs? supporting people making software? evangelizing?
06:07:20 <Biblio> are you familiar with microformats?

06:14:29 <dc_swig> Added comment A3.
06:15:02 <dajobe> I assume the #microformats people know this already
06:15:07 <Biblio> oh, i see, you know GRDDL, so surely you know more than me. i thought it was a general introductory question.
06:15:18 <dajobe> no, I've implemented grddl
06:15:27 <dajobe> but now I've found some of the details
06:15:38 <dajobe> so it seems a GRDDL spec is the first one, you can read the rest
06:16:20 <Biblio> i agree that another name would be desirable
06:16:49 <dajobe> I think they asked around but didn't get good alternatives.
06:17:16 <Biblio> what does it do, exactly? rdf-extract wouldn't do, for instance?
06:17:34 <dajobe> what's that?
06:17:54 <Biblio> i mean, is extracting rdf what grddl does?
06:18:04 <dajobe> yes
06:18:16 <dajobe> but it lets people declare the extraction mapping
06:18:32 <Biblio> so wouldn't rdf-extract be a more compact, easier to remember name?
06:18:51 <dajobe> possibly
06:23:04 <Biblio> dajobe, i reckon you likely know a lot more than me. could i ask your opinion on something i have been brainstorming about?
06:23:21 <dajobe> you can try
06:23:51 <Biblio> this is url 1: http://www.teoriadetodo.com.ar/fips/specs/index.htm
06:24:16 <Biblio> and this is url 2, more specific: http://www.teoriadetodo.com.ar/fips/specs/cdl/anatomy.htm
06:25:42 <Biblio> (mind you, this are pre-pre-pre-alpha notes, just brainstorming)
06:26:49 <dajobe> that covers a lot of existing, well-trod ground
06:26:56 <dajobe> from gml, sgml, xml, .. onwards
06:27:05 <dajobe> would take you about 30 years to do that again I think
06:27:15 <Biblio> lol, probably
06:27:51 <dajobe> what problem are you solving?
06:28:05 <Biblio> mm, there are several, in fact
06:28:17 <Biblio> one of them, is that i think xhtml is wrong
06:28:20 <mlinksva> mlinksva has quit
06:28:49 <Biblio> for instance, nobody seems to know how to edit it in a WYSIWYG way, but *with* perfect code generation
06:29:10 <dajobe> it wasn't designed for everything
06:29:20 <Biblio> also, it does have a very limited set of elements. it does not allow arbitrary ones
06:29:22 <dajobe> code generation doesn't seem like anything related to html to me
06:29:43 <dajobe> the extensibility model was thought about a lot, and has a lot of historical reasons it is that way
06:29:53 <dajobe> go look up the browser wars
06:30:22 <Biblio> i think it was probably logical at that time. for instance, fault-tolerance was preferred over strictness
06:30:40 <Biblio> but then that was corrected when xml came along, right?
06:30:41 <dajobe> arbitrary elements aren't much good when you are trying to build something that many people can browse/render/perceive
06:31:03 <dajobe> this sounds like something for the html mailing list
06:31:05 <Biblio> why not to allow arbitrary datastructures to be plugged?
06:31:25 <dajobe> because nobody will know what they mean
06:31:42 <dajobe> read up on xml's extensibility ideas
06:31:48 <dajobe> it took a different balance
06:32:25 <dajobe> maybe xhtml2 ideas will interest you, or the "html5" stuff
06:33:11 <Biblio> mm, i read some, yes, sensible suggestion. but it still does not allow inclusion of arbitrary datastructures. something like an schema.
06:33:34 <dajobe> that's by design
06:33:43 <dajobe> xml is for arbitrary datastructures
06:33:47 <Biblio> when i see microformats, for instance, it seems to me people trying to plug triangle pegs in round holes
06:34:14 <dajobe> you could put it that way, or see the more pragmatic - take what people use and describe it
06:34:14 <Biblio> xml allows arbitrarty structures, right...but our content language, xhtml, does not, i mean
06:34:25 <dajobe> try the #microformats channel
06:34:54 <Biblio> is that practical, or sheepish, cause nobody proposed something better, or is too scared or concerned about backwards compatibility?
06:35:31 <Biblio> seems like patching to me, i mean. honestly.
06:36:35 <dajobe> * dajobe shrugs
06:37:17 <Biblio> i see. thank you.

20:43:17 <baku> baku has joined #swig
20:48:01 <Biblio> danc, are you there? if you have a minute, there is something i'd like to discuss with you.
20:49:19 <DanC_lap> I'm sorta here... packing. My availability always depends on what the question is about, so it's best to give me a few keywords or something when asking for my attention.
20:50:33 <DanC_lap> Mflows, I can't think of any SWRL reasoners.
20:50:46 <bakunin> bakunin has joined #swig
20:50:52 <Biblio> understood. i think you are working on microformats atm. aren't microformats the wrong way to go, precisely? shouldn't we try to replace html altogether?
20:50:56 <DanC_lap> I use cwm and N3 rules.
20:51:12 <DanC_lap> er... no, and no, Biblio
20:51:56 <Mflows> ok, SWRL seems a never used language. but for what is used?
20:52:06 <DanC_lap> that is: yes, I spend some time on microformats. I don't usually do that with things that I think are precisely the wrong way to go ;-)
20:53:16 <DanC_lap> In fact, W3C just chartered a WG on the technology that is my favorite strategy for connecting microformats to the Semantic Web: http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/grddl-wg/
20:54:43 <DanC_lap> Mflows, "but for what is used"... that doesn't read like typical English. Do you usually speak some other language?
20:54:52 <Biblio> danc, yes...and that0s precisely what worries me. it seems to me that microformats are, basically...well, patching. and that a content authoring language should allow one to plug arbitrary datastructures into it
20:55:16 <baku> baku has quit
20:55:22 <bakunin> bakunin is now known as baku
20:55:40 <Biblio> when i see microformats, however, it looks to me like people trying to plug square pegs into round holes. am i the only one?
20:56:30 <DanC_lap> no... lots of people think microformats are too limited. But show me some other technology that is getting zillions of bloggers to put machine-readable (nearly!) calendar info in the blogs every day.
20:57:07 <peacekeep> anyone wanna answer a noob question? whats a microformat?
20:57:15 <Biblio> dac, i can not. but...precisely...perhaps what we need to do is to replace xhtml?
20:57:31 <DanC_lap> in some respects, a content authoring language should allow one to plug arbitrary datastructures in... that's exactly what RDF/XML is. But it's too flexible to be usable. The parts are too "small".
20:57:36 <DanC_lap> .g microformats
20:57:38 <phenny> DanC_lap: http://microformats.org/
20:57:43 <peacekeep> thx
20:57:50 <Biblio> xml allows insertion of arbitrary datastructures, but xhtml does not, i think, right?
20:57:51 <Mflows> DanC: eheheheh, yes yes, i'm not not english.
20:58:23 <DanC_lap> * DanC_lap can understand a little spanish, if that's much easier
20:58:56 <Biblio> danc, thanks. english would do if my one is decent enough =P
20:59:18 <DanC_lap> Mflows, I'm  not aware of practical usage of SWRL.
21:00:31 <Mflows> maybe, i'm thinking, nobody is practical. i'm doing a little report, for academic purposes, on SWRL, but i don't find projects involving that language
21:00:45 <Mflows> the section "applications" will remain blank.
21:00:55 <DanC_lap> well, yes, in some ways, XML allows insertion of arbitrary datastructures. So does ASCII. So does a string of 0s and 1s. But to not take advantage of the worldwide understanding of XHTML (links, paragraphs, headings) makes things much harder.
21:01:39 <Biblio> danc, i have been brainstorming alittle, and y got a couple of pre-pre-pre-alpha notes on something to replace html altogether. would you care to have a peep?
21:01:42 <DanC_lap> Mflows, have you see the RIF use cases /requirements document? SWRL is one proposal in the area of that working group
21:01:47 <DanC_lap> .g RIF rules use cases w3c
21:01:49 <phenny> DanC_lap: http://www.w3.org/TR/rif-ucr/
21:02:18 <Biblio> this is url 1: http://www.teoriadetodo.com.ar/fips/specs/index.htm
21:02:25 <Biblio> and this is url 2, more specific: http://www.teoriadetodo.com.ar/fips/specs/cdl/anatomy.htm
21:03:59 <DanC_lap> Biblio, I don't see any examples of actual useful data, like calendars or contact info or babesball player averages or anything. The Semantic Web already has a standard for the infrastructure level: RDF
21:05:15 <Biblio> danc, the key idea there is a content authoring language which splits content, prsentation, structure, semantics, and behaviour. and that allows for external definition of them.
21:05:36 <darksatanic> darksatanic has quit
21:05:39 <DanC_lap> well, I guess I don't find that idea very appealing; i.e. not interestingly different from RDF or from XML
21:05:49 <Mflows> danc, that particular link has no mention of the word "swrl",  but in general you have reason, it is inspiring for the next rule interchange format
21:06:11 <ronwalf> ronwalf has joined #swig
21:06:41 <DanC_lap> ah... glad I could find the part of W3C's work that's relevant for your report.
21:07:40 <Biblio> danc, xml allows for arbitrary datastructures...but it is too general as a web wide content authoring language for the masses, isn't it? xhtml, on the other hand, is too limited. what this would allow is to cleanly separate those components
21:08:19 <Mflows> but in the report, and to the audience, i have to answer to the question "but.. in which real world project is used SWRL?"  (seems english-like)
21:09:55 <DanC_lap> I can only wish you luck in answering that question, Mflows.
21:11:09 <DanC_lap> Biblio, when I think of all the things that would have to happen before cdl would allow bloggers to publish event info using it, the list is very, very long. The technical part of web architecture is the small part; the social side (getting agreement, getting people to adopt a specification) is much bigger.
21:11:36 <DanC_lap> It's not at all clear to me that XHTML is too limited.
21:11:41 <DanC_lap> have you seen erdf?
21:11:49 <DanC_lap> .g ERDF XHTML grddl
21:11:52 <phenny> DanC_lap: http://www.mail-archive.com/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf@w3.org/msg00118.html
21:12:03 <Biblio> no, i haven't. i will.
21:12:31 <DanC_lap> .g ERDF embedded rdf
21:12:34 <phenny> DanC_lap: http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki/Main/RdfInHtml
21:12:44 <Biblio> but meantime, regarding xhtml...for one, you can not define any datastructure in say some schema language, and plug it into xhtml, right?
21:12:44 <DanC_lap> ^ that's probably a better place to start.
21:13:59 <DanC_lap> I don't see why not.
21:14:48 <Biblio> how would you do it? i have seem scores of people trying different versions of doing that in the last months, none too convincing. what am i missing?
21:14:49 <Mflows> well, i will ask to the channel the next days, maybe one person, one day, could tell me for what is usefull SWRL
21:15:03 <DanC_lap> I can encode any data structure in a string of 1's and 0's, and I can encode those 1's and 0's in XHTML as well as anything else. There are more straightforward encodings in many interesting cases. But XHTML is just as general purpose as about any other container format.
21:16:51 <Biblio> XHTML is just as general purpose  <--when html was created, it probably made sense, as some "general purpose language". but is it useful today as a general content authoring one?  how do you plug a bibliography, a haiku, any datastructure?
21:17:02 <timbl> * timbl tunes in and starts to rewind
21:17:02 <DanC_lap> if you are not convinced by recent microformats efforts, then I don't know that I can say anything that will convince you. I find the approach appealing. I suppose different people have different intuitions about what is likely to work well.
21:17:12 <d2m> d2m has joined #swig
21:17:48 <Biblio> danc...doen't it look like patching to you?
21:17:53 <larsbot> larsbot has quit
21:18:18 <DanC_lap> are you kidding? there are zillions of bibliographies in XHTML today. Just for example, http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2004/12/24-digpubs.html and http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/misc/vita
21:18:20 <darkling> darkling has quit
21:18:29 <DanC_lap> yes, it's patching. So what? It works.
21:19:02 <Biblio> isn't defining datastructures in some schema language way more general?
21:19:48 <DanC_lap> no
21:19:58 <Biblio> why should we try to plug everything into <ul>'s and the like?
21:20:12 <DanC_lap> because millions (billions?) of people know what <ul> means.
21:20:36 <DanC_lap> if the goal is to communicate, starting with a language that your audience knows helps a lot.
21:21:15 <DanC_lap> (that is: millions of people are comfortable with software that knows how to present <ul> to them.)
21:21:43 <Biblio> but to say that something is an unordered list, does not convey meaning either. a list is a structure, not meaning.
21:22:19 <DanC_lap> umm... I don't think I see your point
21:23:08 <Biblio> xhtml hardwires a few datastrures into it. say lists and tables, paragraphs, and not muc more. is limited. why not extensible, like xml?
21:23:32 <DanC_lap> it is extensible. rel, class, profile, etc.
21:23:34 <Biblio> why not <bibliography>, <haiku>, <recipe>, etc?
21:23:35 <baku> baku has quit
21:25:30 <Biblio> instead of using say class, wound't it be better to define a schema somewhere else, and allow it to be plugged in?
21:25:57 <DanC_lap> Maybe, but I don't think so...
21:26:07 <DanC_lap> ... each of us will just have to try what we think is best and see what happens.
21:26:14 <Biblio> as long as the schema is accessible for everyone, i think is way cleaner for machine processing
21:27:17 <DanC_lap> well, perhaps... and if machines were the only thing that was going to process the data, that would be one thing. But machines are not the end target. people are.
21:27:42 <DanC_lap> I suppose the canonical "why microformats? why not just XML?" is http://tantek.com/log/2005/07.html#towerofbabelproblem . I find it fairly appealing.
21:28:04 <Biblio> danc, so the problem would be how to render one such schema, once plugged into a content language?
21:28:40 <Biblio> danc, is tantek's argument "we can not change everything, so let's patch up?
21:28:50 <DanC_lap> well, yes... how to render it... how to integrate it with databases that people use, how to present it to blind people, etc. ... how to connect it to all the things that XHML is connected to.
21:29:19 <DanC_lap> I don't think so... I think the argument is "don't reinvent when you can use what's already there."
21:30:22 <DanC_lap> the value of the network goes up with the square of the number of resources. The network of XHTML is _big_. It's worth a _lot_ to connect to it. Approaches that look like patching are more cost-effective than trying to start over.
21:31:04 <Biblio> i think there is a limit, passing which,is becomes more cost effective to start over
21:31:35 <Biblio> regarding rendering...why not via css?
21:31:38 <DanC_lap> well, yes, there are limits...

21:31:56 <DanC_lap> ... and microformats are not for everything. But they're good for a lot of simple, useful things.
21:32:12 <DanC_lap> for the more general case, I find RDF/XML more appealing.
21:32:46 <DanC_lap> in the interest of full disclosure, I have been on the <recipe> side of things; in Oct 1998 I wrote http://www.nature.com/nature/webmatters/xml/xml.html . And I still think XML is good for lots of stuff. But microformats are good too.
21:32:46 <Biblio> xml is too general for the masses, i think. and xhtml too limited
21:33:15 <Biblio> recipes, good =P
21:33:26 <DanC_lap> XHTML has a long way to go before we hit its limits, I'm quite confident.
21:34:18 <Biblio> i think it was designed at the beggining of the web, when we did not know many things. and i think many things are quite wrong
21:35:06 <peacekeep> danc you work at w3c ?
21:35:20 <Biblio> for instance, what is wrong with html: http://www.teoriadetodo.com.ar/fips/specs/cdl/problems1.htm
21:36:31 <Biblio> HTML was not created with WYSIWYG-edting in mind.  <--this one alone is enough to make sense starting over again, i think
21:36:34 <iv_an_ru> iv_an_ru has quit
21:36:40 <DanC_lap> yes, I work at W3C. http://www.w3.org/People/Connolly/
21:36:51 <iv_an_ru> iv_an_ru has joined #swig
21:37:06 <DanC_lap> huh? where did you get that information? yes, HTML _was_ created with WYSIWYG editing in mind.
21:37:15 <Biblio> was it?
21:37:25 <DanC_lap> yes.
21:37:41 <Biblio> that includes "with perfect code generation at the same time"?
21:38:00 <DanC_lap> HTML was created by taking the NeXTStep RTF editing widget and using a few color bits to encoding hypertext links, and then wriiting that out in SGML.
21:38:54 <DanC_lap> "HTML was not created with extensibility in mind." I don't know where you get your information; you're misinformed.
21:39:40 <Biblio> danc, might be, i'm still just collecting ideas. but...if html was extensible, why the X in xhtml?
21:39:47 <DanC_lap> marketing
21:40:29 <Biblio> i seems to be seriously missinformed all right, then
21:40:33 <timbl> Errrr....  HTML was not created with WYSIWYG-edting in mind.?    Actually it was.
21:40:55 <Biblio> why does hald the planet hand code it, then?
21:40:59 <Biblio> *half
21:41:06 <DanC_lap> "HTML was not created with semantics in mind." please cite a source for all these claims. They're perposterous. One of the earliest HTML specs says "HTML is an SGML document type with fairly generic
21:41:06 <DanC_lap>    semantics appropriate for representing information from a wide
21:41:06 <DanC_lap>    range of applications." -- http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/draft-ietf-iiir-html-01
21:41:18 <timbl> That the plnet hand-codes HTML is one of te biggest mysteries
21:41:38 <Biblio> timbl, there might be some reasons for it, then?
21:41:41 <timbl> The first browser was a WYSIWYG editor.   You were never supposed to see HTML or   URIs really
21:42:04 <DanC_lap> the planet hand-codes it because (a) they can and (b) authoring tools haven't caught up with the sorts of things people want to express. But actually, if you count by number of authors, I'd say a lot more than half of them use something like MS Frontpage.
21:42:13 <timbl> One reason is that the HTML people used in browsers got complicated fatser than the editors could keep up.
21:42:42 <timbl> Or Nvu or Amaya.
21:42:43 <DanC_lap> well, any more, more than half of them probably use <textareas> in blogging tools.
21:42:53 <peacekeep> i hand-code because it's easier than an editor :D
21:42:55 <Biblio> danc, that does not include, at the same time, perfect code generation, does it? we can do wysiwyg in word, but the code...you know
21:43:39 <DanC_lap> right... the HTML code produced by word is an example of the sorry state of the art in authoring tools.
21:43:51 <Biblio> regarding being semantic...danc, tyhen why we do not have a semantic web yet?
21:44:25 <timbl> Biblio,  "In today's standards bodies, nobody represents end-users. Corporations pay the bills, instead."
21:44:35 <Biblio> when considering the point on wysiwyg, please read "with perfect code generation at the same time", please
21:45:12 <timbl> Well, ay W3C, the coporations do pay many of the bills, but they let a lot of penniless kees participate too, which is pretty nice of gtem, no?  Would you prefer to pay the bills too?
21:45:36 <DanC_lap> * DanC_lap struggles to read "penniless kees"
21:45:48 <timbl> Biblio,  have you tried Amaya or Nvu?
21:45:49 <Biblio> i'd rather have my national government pay the bills, timbl, which i voted.
21:45:57 <timbl> penniless Geeks sorry
21:46:06 <Biblio> tibl, a little yes, and not bad. but i think we could do better
21:46:19 <DanC_lap> W3C gets about 1/3rd of its funding from government contracts. (or it did at one time). And yes, that's a good thing.
21:46:38 <DanC_lap> and quite a few of our members are parts of various governments
21:46:59 <Biblio> i voted my national government, i did not vote w3c. the web is an anarchy
21:47:08 <DanC_lap> oh... I see what you mean.
21:47:18 <Biblio> but please, that discussion is bigger. =P
21:47:22 <DanC_lap> well, you vote every time you choose a browser or write a web page, in a way.
21:47:32 <Biblio> i did not mind to get the scope that big here
21:47:51 <Biblio> danc, yes, but i have nobody accountable for systems not working
21:48:24 <DanC_lap> indeed... much bigger scope, that. Any chance we'll be in the same place at the same time to discuss it over a beer?
21:48:50 <Biblio> danc...i'm a pennyless argentinian, so i doubt it. my loss =(
21:49:10 <Biblio> i'm sure it would be wuite a lot of beers, though =P
21:49:13 <timbl> Governments tend to fund the research which is further out.   Sometimes they fund standards, as with the W3C start, and with OWL, for example.
21:49:48 <Biblio> timbl, not bad. i believe we can do better though.
21:50:22 <Biblio> if you people peruse those url's of mine, you'll notice i did not want to open discussion on some subjects too soon
21:50:31 <Biblio> political economical, social levels
21:50:40 <Biblio> i just limited to the technical, for now
21:51:04 <Biblio> just the technical is already hughe enough
21:51:40 <timbl> Well, at least you can remove "HTML was not created with WYSIWYG-edting in mind." :)
21:52:01 <timbl> Have you tried Notation3?
21:52:22 <Biblio> timbl...perhaps, yes, but..was it really? if so, how come we can not do wysiwyg *with perfect code generation* yet?
21:53:00 <Biblio> timbl, no, i just learned a few things about rdf, etc, here, theorugh a couple on dan's links like a year back. you guys know way more than i do
21:53:56 <DanC_lap> * DanC_lap looks around for tabulator release announcement...
21:54:03 <Biblio> xstandard.com   <--the best attempt to do wysiwyg with perfect code generation i know of.
21:54:39 <timbl> When HTML  was *designed* you just edit any web page and save it is you had authority.   But that form of HTML was very simple. The code generated was perfect  (as the program was more or less definitive)
21:54:51 <timbl> For the semantic side, check oiy N3
21:54:58 <timbl> check out N3
21:55:01 <Biblio> i will, thanks
21:55:22 <Biblio> timbl...at any rate, we can not do both things at the same time today
21:55:59 <Biblio> which means that grandma and grandpa, the two most important people on the web, have to learn html . css, and the whole acronim list
21:56:04 <DanC_lap> hmm... http://xstandard.com/ ... interesting. I wonder why I hadn't heard of that one before.
21:56:27 <Biblio> danc, took me ages to find people trying to do this, and just about nobody knows them
21:56:53 <Biblio> they use activex, etc, bad neas, the implementation. but at least they try to help grandma and grandpa
21:57:25 <Biblio> complexity should be hidden from usewrs. users should be users, not geeks
21:57:43 <timbl> Absolutely
21:58:38 <DanC_lap> yes, activex means i can't try it out right now. But it's still interesting.
21:58:50 <Biblio> the idea, at least, yes
21:59:15 <Biblio> something like that should be priority one for the whole web, i think
21:59:36 <Biblio> millions of grandmas can not create content easily today
22:00:03 <Biblio> (with perfect code generation, content ready for the semantic web, etc etc)
22:00:54 <Biblio> all machine processable
22:01:30 <DanC_lap> yes... well... meanwhile, the market has a lot to do with how technology gets deployed, and the market keeps paying for ms word.
22:01:45 <Biblio> the web is an anarchy, you see?
22:02:18 <DanC_lap> well, it's a web... with people and governments and organizations of all sorts and all scales.
22:02:27 <Biblio> nobosy accountable
22:02:34 <DanC_lap> everybody is accountable.
22:02:45 <Biblio> not voted, not sackable
22:03:06 <DanC_lap> well, voted with time and $$ as often as ballots.
22:03:19 <Biblio> not the same, i'm afraid =P
22:04:20 <Biblio> would i reccomend tbl and danc to run the web if world governments did something about it? probably yes, nice people. but not the same, i think

22:05:26 <DanC_lap> net governance is really, really tricky. Biblio, I wonder if you've seen http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Fractal . (oh... I see timbl has updated it since I last read it.)
22:06:10 <DanC_lap> Biblio, I'm curious... where do you live? i.e. what government do you have the most experience with? In America, we tend not to trust governments so much.
22:06:14 <Biblio> ahh, the desing issues section, very interesting. danc, tbl wrote much stuff in the 90's, he'd liten to you, he needs to update some of those
22:06:20 <Biblio> *listen
22:06:49 <Biblio> danc, i live in argetina, and we trust governments even a lot less here
22:07:00 <Biblio> a *lot*
22:07:22 <Biblio> but here we are dealing with systems. and systems mean interoperability
22:07:35 <DanC_lap> Argentina. interesting. Much gusto. :)
22:07:41 <Biblio> i don't want dictators. but i want systems to work
22:07:43 <DanC_lap> Mucho gusto.
22:07:49 <Biblio> gusto es mio, dan =P
22:07:55 <DanC_lap> * DanC_lap is learning to type ;-)
22:08:09 <Biblio> i misstype a lot, sorry
22:08:33 <DanC_lap> the "personal excercise" section of http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Fractal is what I think is most relevant to your points about anarchy, Biblio .
22:08:57 <Biblio> danc, i see what you mean. but...when there was talk about internet overnance (tunez, some months back), tha us planted a meme
22:09:45 <Biblio> "internet government means dictatorship, and nothing will work due to burocracy" , which is all false
22:10:08 <Biblio> in fact the us wants echelon to keep spying on all of us, if anyone ask me
22:10:14 <Biblio> but i digress
22:10:23 <DanC_lap> * DanC_lap is pretty depressed about the US lately
22:10:23 <Biblio> thanks much for the fractal link, dan
22:10:43 <DanC_lap> welcome
22:10:46 <Biblio> it would not be too polite for me to comment on bush, etc, dan. but...
22:11:03 <DanC_lap> indeed, there is little to say about Bush that is polite ;-)
22:11:11 <Biblio> agreed =P
22:11:46 <briansuda> briansuda has quit
22:12:41 <Biblio> tbl wrote on the design section about why rdf, why just not xml. but that is from 1998. now there is talk of xml databases, things evolved. perhaps he should update
22:14:07 <Biblio> regarding the fractal thing and decentralization, and so on, i mostly agree. but have you seen my rationales for desing goals for those languages? zen like
22:14:36 <Biblio> maximal modularity, maximal extensibility, everything independence
22:15:11 <Biblio> for example, no hardwired datastructures, but a generic extensibility mechanism
22:15:12 <DanC_lap> * DanC_lap finds this stuff about signing statements deeply disturbing. http://zestyping.livejournal.com/188380.html
22:23:24 <Biblio> <timbl> When HTML  was *designed* you just edit any web page and save it is you had authority.   But that form of HTML was very simple.   <---the modifications i propose make it simple again, timbl, i think. zen-like, in fact
22:27:51 <timbl> You had a pointer to the problems -- was there one to your solution too?
22:28:49 <Biblio> timbl, http://www.teoriadetodo.com.ar/fips/  <--very very alpha, just brainstorming yet, but is the best i have
22:30:39 <Biblio> this is probaly the key idea, regarding languages: http://www.teoriadetodo.com.ar/fips/specs/cdl/anatomy.htm
22:31:15 <Biblio> total separation of content, from presentation, from structure, from meaning, from behaviour

11:23:40 <bengee> IvanHerman, just because Mark says RDFa is not bound to XHTML2 doesn't make it a true statement ;)
11:24:06 <IvanHerman> :-)
11:24:08 <bengee> everything after point 2 in his note is not in xhtml1
11:24:23 <IvanHerman> the intention is to produce an xhtml1 module for RDFa
11:24:42 <IvanHerman> that might be xhtml1.X, of course
11:25:07 <IvanHerman> but the point is that one does not have to incude all the non-backward-compatible aspects of xhtml 2
11:25:23 <IvanHerman> strictly speaking: you are right, though!
11:25:57 <bengee> * bengee stops;)

12:06:28 <emc> Hello everybody, what would you suggest is the best way of describing "bob" is "very-good" at "painting" in rdf? I have a couple of ideas but don't know which is the best way to describe it (best as in "scalable", "standardized" and "simple") ... all parameters would need to be customizeable... what are your suggestions?
12:09:32 <lkagal> lkagal has joined #swig
12:09:46 <sbp> emc: how many scales of talent would you have?
12:09:50 <phenny> sbp: 11:52Z <Morbus> tell sbp yay, broke 1000 points last night http://gamerscorechart.com/theme/xbox/Morbus_Iff_Else.png
12:09:54 <phenny> sbp: 11:52Z <Morbus> tell sbp by comparison, NA's top scores are nearing 50k.
12:09:58 <phenny> sbp: 11:53Z <Morbus> tell sbp http://www.mygamercard.net/leaderboard.php
12:10:05 <sbp> emc: if only a few, I'd model them as properties
12:10:52 <sbp> so for example, you could have [ foaf:name "Bob Fleming"; :skill wn:Painting ] .
12:11:24 <emc> sbp: the talents such as "painting" will be fully scalable meaning i want to attach a tag cloud to it and people can make up random talents here. the "very-good" part however can be limited a fixed number, i guess. but it would be good if this could scale as well.
12:12:04 <Rickm> Rickm has joined #swig
12:12:06 <sbp> wordnet is good for stuff like the former
12:12:29 <sbp> as for the latter, you should only model the distinctions which are valuable to model
12:13:12 <sbp> I doubt you're going to need 50 levels of talent, unless you're describing, say, grades attained at art school over several years or something, but even in that case you'd model it entirely differently anyway

17:35:53 <Ciantic> Anybody knows if it's possible with upcoming XHTML2.0 to create appropriate semantics with metadata-element for example "text ... posted by Alex, modified 2006-01-01 10:00:00"
17:36:55 <Ciantic> Metainformation page in XHTML 2.0 specs is a bit confusing in that matter.
17:38:14 <bengee> do you know rdfa.info, Ciantic?
17:38:21 <Ciantic> bengee, nope
17:38:54 <bengee> there should be links to an early primer which should illustrate that use case
17:39:22 <Ciantic> bengee, are you simply saying that it is possible to create metadata/ or about-property for any element... which is not currently possible
17:39:43 <bengee> .g rdfa primer
17:39:46 <phenny> bengee: http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-rdfa-primer/
17:40:54 <bengee> rdfa uses <meta> iirc
17:41:43 <Ciantic> hmm, rdfa
17:42:29 <bengee> as I learned 2day, they plan to turn it into an xhtml 1.something module

17:44:42 <conan> conan has joined #swig
17:45:13 <Ezku\> Ezku\ has joined #swig
17:47:02 <Ciantic> bengee, question is when you can use this rdfa
17:47:42 <bengee> when xhtml allows you to use un-qualified attributes ;)
17:47:53 <bengee> if you want something that works today and doesn't confuse validators, you might want to look at eRDF
17:48:07 <bengee> .g erdf rdf
17:48:10 <phenny> bengee: http://research.talis.com/2005/erdf/wiki/Main/RdfInHtml
17:50:09 <EliasT> EliasT has joined #swig
17:52:55 <bengee> fwiw, you *can* use RDFa, it won't kick browsers into quirks mode, but for developers, the warnings can get annoying, e.g. if your dev browser uses a validator extension
17:59:29 <Ciantic> bengee, it's a real shame that you'll have to everytime type example <meta property="contact:title"> even though <meta property="title"> would be enough, if the meta is inside the "contact"
18:00:40 <Ciantic> I'm trying to figure out how to do easiest for example forum posts metadatas with that and it does not seem too handy for me
18:00:46 <bengee> well, you could of course pick a shorter prefix, e.g. c:title
18:01:06 <lkagal> lkagal has joined #swig
18:01:10 <Ciantic> bengee, how does that work if you have several posts in same page?
18:01:18 <Ciantic> bengee, like in forum
18:01:50 <Ciantic> p1:author ... p100:author etc ?
18:02:15 <bengee> the prefix just defines the vocabulary you are using
18:02:38 <bengee> each post would need an id
18:02:52 <Ciantic> bengee, and you should use about-attribute?
18:03:12 <bengee> then the id together with the property and a value forms a triple
18:03:56 <bengee> the about vs. id thing in RDFa is a bit confusing, id should be enough
18:04:03 <Ciantic> bengee, basically <meta about="#post1" property="post:author">James</meta>
18:04:25 <bengee> but to be honest, I stopped struggling with RDFa an switched to eRDF
18:04:36 <bengee> so, I'm clearly biased ;)
18:04:45 <Ciantic> bengee, umm, "about" points to ID how can you deprecate about
18:05:56 <NachoAway> NachoAway is now known as NachoMan
18:06:23 <bengee> to me it should be something along <div id="post1"><span property="dc:creator">John Doe</>...</>
18:07:09 <bengee> that's at least how eRDF does it, although they use existing attrs (class in this case)
18:07:10 <Ciantic> bengee, yes, but about is used when the property-attribute containing element is not inside the <div id="post1"
18:07:40 <chimezie> .seen danja
18:07:42 <phenny> Sorry, I haven't seen danja around.
18:07:57 <bengee> then your example above should be ok, I'd say
18:09:02 <Ciantic> erdf is stupid compromise :p
18:09:26 <bengee> as are microformats, but they are a huge success ;)
18:10:13 <bengee> and s/stupid/pragmatic/
18:10:31 <Ciantic> bengee, huge success because real way to do it ain't available
18:10:57 <bengee> flamewars, this way please..
18:11:21 <Ciantic> bengee, you don't agree that it is overuse of class? :)
18:11:28 <EliasT> * EliasT is on the phone, but amused with the conversation.
18:11:51 <bengee> no
18:12:08 <bengee> * bengee waves
18:12:58 <Ciantic> bengee, exemplery in this line there is way too much markup vs. content "Hi, I'm <span class="foaf-name"><span class="foaf-firstName">Anna</span> <span class="foaf-surname">Wilder</span></span>"
18:13:28 <bengee> but that creates 3 triples, try the same in RDFa
18:14:48 <Ciantic> bengee, I'm not saying that any of those are solution but it should lookike more "Hi, I'm <c:name><c:first>Anna..." to be usable
18:15:22 <EliasT> that looks like XML to me.
18:15:24 <Ciantic> too much crap in the class solution as is in the meta-element solution
18:15:29 <EliasT> * EliasT ducks.
18:15:34 <bengee> oh, there is something they call, wait, ah, rdf/xml
18:15:56 <bengee> rdf/xml allows you to get rid of all the html markup, too!
18:16:10 <Ciantic> EliasT, there should be something like possibility define any named elements as span, and with css to refine them to needs
18:16:36 <EliasT> example use case of that?
18:16:45 <Ciantic> EliasT, above?
18:17:12 <EliasT> I meant why would I want c:name, c:first in an HTML file?
18:17:30 <Ciantic> EliasT, instead of <span property="c:name"> ?
18:17:37 <EliasT> right
18:17:46 <bengee> hey, you could put it in comments!
18:17:47 <Ciantic> well because it's way easier to write

18:18:24 <Ciantic> EliasT, thats right, there should be something like possibility to extend it to the needs
18:18:58 <EliasT> we are having problems with just the @property vs @class to introduce c:first would be fruitless.

22:37:36 <emc> it's a school project for the moment but it may become as big as google ;)
22:37:42 <iv_an_ru> Look at Virtuoso Open Source. That's like the one you mention with the added bonus of being an XML and RDF DBMS.

15:15:30 <bblfish> question regarding mime types
15:15:37 <bblfish> and rdf
15:16:00 <bblfish> since all rdf can be served with just one mime type, how is one to tell what data is at a particular location?
15:16:29 <bblfish> I suppose that the link pointing to a particular URL usually gives some indication
15:16:41 <CaptSolo> bblfish: aren't there different mime type for rdf/xml and rdf/n3 ?
15:16:48 <DanC_lap> DanC_lap has joined #swig
15:17:09 <bblfish> CaptSolo: I did say "can" .
15:17:19 <bblfish> All rdf can be served with just one of those
15:19:18 <CaptSolo> ok
15:19:28 <bblfish> in xml for example people (ab)use mime types as a way of specifying what is to be found in a document. Eg:
15:20:01 <CaptSolo> not sure mime-types are meant for that
15:20:15 <bblfish> see: http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg05678.html
15:20:25 <CaptSolo> same as mimetype is not meant for telling me *what* appears on a picture
15:20:36 <CaptSolo> mimetype: image/xxx
15:20:36 <bblfish> in atom for example there is the application/atom+xml mime type
15:20:46 <CaptSolo> right
15:20:58 <bblfish> then they want the application/atomserv+xml for other xml feeds they are just specifying
15:21:10 <CaptSolo> * CaptSolo wonders what web standards people consider the best practice
15:22:04 <CaptSolo> the thing is - even if you say that this is Atom information in RDf, there can be a number of different ways of expressing same graph in RDF/XML
15:22:04 <snail> mime-types are for the format of the content not the content or functionality of the content, right?
15:22:06 <bblfish> Now in atom (see above link) it is getting a little silly, because you can imagine how a list of categories may need its own mime type, etc
15:22:31 <CaptSolo> so it won't help to process RDF w/o a proper RDF parser (eg. using XSLT)
15:22:52 <bblfish> I think some people use mime types as a way to specify what the xml namespace is at the end of a link
15:22:58 <CaptSolo> if you are handling it as RDF there should be better way to express what can one expect from the dataset
15:23:22 <IvanHerman> IvanHerman has quit
15:23:41 <CaptSolo> looks like that
15:23:57 <bblfish> CaptSolo: yes so for example [ a :Entry; :categories_list <./cats/> ].
15:24:31 <bblfish> that should tell you that there is a categories_list of things at <./cats/>
15:24:45 <bblfish> which is fine.
15:25:48 <bblfish> Just one little niggle. Since in rdf one can have all kinds of resources that are owl:sameAs other resources, someone could place a list of categories using a vocabulary that is a mirror of the one I was expecting, but contained no words I understood
15:28:02 <snail> bblfish: which is why you should list the owl:sameAs definitions you know aobut?
15:29:16 <bblfish> You mean the person writing the document using the ontology I don't know about should in his ontology have links to ontology mapping docs
15:29:34 <bblfish> makes sense
15:29:57 <bblfish> I suppose one has an expectation that a particular vocab will be used
15:31:51 <bblfish> so if there were a foaf:foaffile relation in foaf one would expect the object resource to contain foaf vocab?
15:32:24 <bblfish> _:me foaf:foaffile <http://eg.com/foaf.rdf> .
15:32:45 <bblfish> one would expect http://eg.com/foaf.rdf to contain foaf terms?
15:32:56 <bblfish> I suppose its obviously yes
15:33:02 <bblfish> So I'll just move on...
15:35:49 <bblfish> sorry I was just trying to see how best to anwser http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg05877.html

15:38:54 <CaptSolo> bblfish: hmmm, re. foaffile containing FOAF terms - it might, along with other data. but it won't specify what foaf data will be there and in what combinations with other data.
15:38:57 <CaptSolo> hmm....
15:39:05 <chimezie> chimezie has joined #swig
15:39:28 <CaptSolo> if you are generating the RDF (hence you know what's in it) could you attach some kind of a "template" to it to show what data people can expect
15:39:40 <CaptSolo> and what questions they can expect to be answered
15:40:28 <CaptSolo> having a way to say something is a FoafFile and having some expectations (or formal description) of what can be in such file would help
15:40:40 <CaptSolo> btw - it'd better be a class (FoafFile) not a property
15:40:58 <bblfish> GoodPoint
15:41:29 <bblfish> yes. Such a vocab would be very useful. Something to state what type of information a document contains.
15:41:30 <CaptSolo> then you can say [ "" a foaf:FoafFile . ] (this is a foaf file)

16:29:20 <bblfish> I would really like the train people to publish their timetables in rdf or with a sparql end point

16:30:33 <EliasT> they can have all of their phd's breaking walls with awesome algorithms to understand spammers all they want and directing the whole world how to markup their pages so their algorithms work, but that's not the semantic web to me.
16:30:47 <chimezie> seems like most counter arguments to SW start off with the assumption that it's an all or nothing proposition
16:31:04 <darksatanic> And also with assumptions of accuracy and consistency.
16:31:33 <EliasT> exactly. I was at WWW2006 and was at a panel where Frank XXX had slides about the 4 misconceptions people have of the SW. 4? I guess he was wrong.
16:31:37 <bblfish> I agree. All you need is some people to open up a database to sparql, and the fun will begin
16:32:09 <bblfish> Sadly the people most likely to understand it are in the sili valley, and they don't have the data that the old enterprises have
16:32:11 <darksatanic> The main argument against that, though, is "Why should I? What do I get out of it?"
16:32:19 <EliasT> My concerns aren't to come up with a markup that solves Google ranking problems.

16:44:42 <bblfish> oh I see :-). I thought you were using Jena and had it enabled.
16:45:55 <bblfish> Now the idea of what a graph should be is one that has been intriguing me. I was thinking along the lines that the URL where you GET the resource should be the graph name

16:47:13 <EliasT> those are "locations" where the graph exists.
16:47:22 <EliasT> but not the identify of it.. just my opinion.
16:47:27 <EliasT> that's why I use a URN for the name.
16:47:39 <EliasT> the graph exists in a DB with name urn:lsid:...

17:05:54 <AaronSw> well, that's one Way and the one I was criticizing
17:06:10 <danja> but the Wikipedia is part of that way
17:07:01 <danja> multiple, centralised points
17:07:20 <AaronSw> I don't think that's a very helpful way to look at it.
17:07:38 <AaronSw> Obviously, if you zoom out far enough you can see everything as part of something
17:07:52 <AaronSw> but the real question is what's the way the majority of people publish information.
17:08:04 <AaronSw> If it's thru publishing RDF files on their web sites, we should work on tools to make that easy.
17:08:12 <danja> er, you don't have to zoom far to see that Wikipedia's on the web

17:27:58 <chimezie> well that's the thing, I wrote the SPARQL XML result writer to use The processing of XML namespaces in saxutils.XMLGenerator is
17:27:58 <chimezie> so blatantly broken that I wonder if it ever has been tested
17:28:14 <chimezie> sigh.. fat fingers
17:28:31 <danja> heh, unfortunately it made some sense...
17:28:41 <chimezie> i was hoping that in using xml.sax.saxutils, there would be no introduced dependecies on third-party xml processors

17:32:02 <chimezie> yeah, I'm not sure what to do, actually.  I'll have to come back to that one :(
17:32:58 <chimezie> actually, what I can do is write up a seperate SPARQL XML writer to use 4Suite since (in your case) you already have it installed.  Should be straight forward enough
17:35:15 <danja> hmm, at the bottom of that atlassian thread it says
17:35:18 <danja> Stuart Bishop's patch fixes the
17:35:18 <danja> issue; could someone commit it please?
17:36:42 <danja> I've got to nip out for a bit, but I'll try that when I get back
17:37:04 <chimezie> Yeah, that might be your best bet..

17:43:16 <iv_an_ru> OpenLink Virtuoso and OpenLink Data Spaces because they solve the RDF product and consumption issue in ways that covers the Wikipedia and RDF generation examples stated earlier.

17:44:34 <AaronSw> * AaronSw investigates
17:44:45 <iv_an_ru> Virtuoso is an ORDBMS with SQL, RDF, and XML data management capabilities. ODS is an distributed collaborative application suite built using Virtuoso. For instance, post installation of ODS you get Web 2.0 application profiles such as: Blogs, Wikis, Bookmark Managers, Feed Aggregators (e.g. Digg, Reddit, Bloglines etc..), Discussion Forums, and more creating data (by way of natural user interaction) with the product of data that is mapped to ontologies suc
17:45:38 <AaronSw> you got cut off at "suc"
17:46:38 <iv_an_ru> Discussion Forums, and more creating data (by way of natural user interaction) with the product of data that is mapped to ontologies such SIOC, FOAF, and Atom OWL. You then have access to the data via RDF Data Set snapshots (plain old RDF files)  via WebDAV/HTTP or the broader data graph using SPARQL via the automatically generated SPARQL endpoint

17:54:09 <iv_an_ru> ODS (OpenLink Data Spaces) allows you to create a point of Semantic Web Presence from Web 2.0 distributed collaborative application profiles by injecting the missing "open data access" and "flexible data model" elements to the current Web 2.0 mix.
17:54:28 <iv_an_ru> ODS basically provides an atomic container from which you interact with application logic (function specific services) or data (via query services such as SPARQL and GData).
17:54:42 <schepers> schepers has joined #swig
17:54:46 <iv_an_ru> ODS does not mean the Wikis, Blogs etc.. must be ODS based, it can grab data from anywhere since it support Atom 1.0 publishing and older blogosphere protocols such as Metaweblog, Moveable Type, and Blogger 1.0 and 2.0 re. Blog archives in Atom, RSS 2.0, RSS 1.1 formats etc..
17:55:41 <iv_an_ru> So it can get data from a variety of places and then expose this data via RDF Data Sets based on SIOC (where each application realm equals a SIOC forum and each ODS instance equals a SIOC site)
17:59:28 <iv_an_ru> Sample query for data from ODS:   (SPARQL Service: http://myopenlink.net:8890/sparql/ )

18:03:37 <iv_an_ru> Each ODS Data Space App. (or App. Realm) is equipped with conversation capability (think Digg in the case of Blog Posts or standard blog posts with comments snabled).
18:03:37 <iv_an_ru> This conversation feature (once enabled) hands over threaded discussion to Virtuoso's in-built NNTP engine.
18:03:37 <iv_an_ru> At the same time on the surface the Conversation management is taken over by the Discussion Data Space Application.
18:03:37 <iv_an_ru> Now, since this is a SIOC Forum you marry NNTP and SIOC forums without any fuss.
18:03:38 <iv_an_ru> This gives you multiple entry points for participating in, and managing, threaded discussions that originate from blogs, wikis, photo gallaries (a la flickr) etc..
18:03:41 <iv_an_ru> While also exposing the threaded discussion data to SPARQL via SIOC :-

01:47:15 <timbl> Well, I don'r raed all of it.

01:47:34 <timbl> Some email I don't get to.
01:48:15 <timbl> But when I do discuss technology, I tend to prefer to do it in a public forum where I can reuse the discussion and refer to it later.
01:48:32 <timbl> So I don't do much private email about technology.
01:48:40 <Biblio> so do i, and if you prefer any other method, please tell me

01:51:22 <Biblio> i see. and i undestand. xhtml 2.0 does break backwards compatibility, though. sometimes, from time to time...some bigger evolutionary leaps are justified

05:07:18 <lilo> [Global Notice] Hi all. We experienced a fairly major network-wide glitch, we're thinking it's a denial. Looking at it now. Thanks for your patience.
05:08:40 <lilo> [Global Notice] We're also getting reports of peering problems, though; we're still investigating.

05:29:51 <lilo> [Global Notice] Okay. We've got a bit more information. It appears our problems began at the same time as a Cogent depeering incident, around 4:05 UTC. We're assuming it's a peering issue. We'll continue to look into it and will let you know on wallops (/mode YOURNICK +w) if we get more information. Thanks for your patience, and thank you for using freenode!

10:09:41 <ndw> So far they're holding up to the heat pretty well.

20:35:17 <kjetil_> * kjetil_ lost the context of the p2p comment
20:35:32 <CaptSolo> i am sure xmlns.com and others are in the cache of browsers of many people over here
20:35:46 <timbl> The context was foaf being down
20:35:48 <CaptSolo> kjetil_: 21:11 < ronwalf> xmlns.com down?
20:35:53 <kjetil_> ah, right :-)
20:35:54 <CaptSolo> 22:26 < timbl> Maybe we should work on peer-peer fallback for HTTP then.
20:35:58 <libby> oops is it? he had some network problems

20:36:45 <kjetil_> but yeah, it would be kinda nice to use HTTP URIs even though your data may be stored on a p2p network
20:37:15 <kjetil_> for example, an addressbook, where all your friends have a copy of your entry
20:37:49 <kjetil_> has there been any work on using HTTP URIs for that kind of stuff?
20:38:17 <kjetil_> (just as an apropos to p2p and HTTP)
20:43:48 <ndw> thanks, dajobe.

21:06:55 <kjetil_> ok
21:07:26 <kjetil_> I think that's an interesting issue since data that should be shared well can reside on P2P networks
21:08:08 <CaptSolo> kjetil_: did you get the priv-msgs i sent you the other day?
21:08:17 <kjetil_> ah, yeah
21:08:39 <kjetil_> I'm about to run out the door, so I won't identify right now
21:08:46 <CaptSolo> good :) did not see a reply so was wondering
21:09:04 <kjetil_> there is still no time to look at SIOC, but I hope things will improve soonish
21:09:35 <CaptSolo> it would also be good to get to know more about Opera's efforts
21:09:54 <kjetil_> yup
21:10:01 <CaptSolo> that way maybe people have more information to think about and come up with some good ideas

22:37:52 <dmiles_afk> like Cyc can talk to: MSAccess   MSSQLServer   MySQL-TheProgram   OracleDatabaseServer-TheProgram   PostgreSQL   .. so what would i need to talk to your SARQL?

22:43:13 <kingsleyidehen> dmmilew_afk: OpenLink Software provides a MySQL2iODBC toolkit that enables you to relieve applications of their MySQL specificity
22:43:22 <kingsleyidehen> see: http://iodbc.org for details
22:43:55 <kingsleyidehen> Once you relink your MySQL specific app. using this kit you can then work with MySQL or any other ODBC accessible DBMS
22:44:31 <kingsleyidehen> Naturally, you will have to migrate the DBMS schema and then move the data
22:45:18 <kingsleyidehen> since DDL migration automation isn't covered by the kit. That said, Virtuoso (and other tools) provide SQL to SQL schema and data migrations
22:45:46 <lkagal> lkagal has quit
22:45:59 <kingsleyidehen> in automated fashion via replication (homogeneous or heterogeneous)
22:47:27 <kingsleyidehen> we have used the aforementioned kit to decouple phpBB from MySQL such that is works with Virtuoso (or any other ODBC accessible DBMS) as a SQL Data Store
22:48:25 <kingsleyidehen> In the case of Virtuoso we took this one step further by integrating the SQL data with Virtuoso's NNTP engine such that phpBB becomes a front for NNTP managed discussions
22:48:30 <kingsleyidehen> threads
22:49:59 <kingsleyidehen> What gets very interesting is how we've mapped NNTP managed discussions in our ODS product to the SIOC ontology
22:51:52 <kingsleyidehen> so you can instigate "conversations" in blogs, wikis, and other data space applications that are automatically managed by the NNTP engine and most importantly mapped to SIOC and exposed to SPARQL
22:52:26 <kingsleyidehen> got to go now but I think iv_an_ru is available to answer any questions etc..

23:04:24 <dmiles_afk> ah relinking.. have a closed src infrasructure at the moemnt.. but i can probly load my .so/.dll and write a driver that can talk to it .. by playing with the MySQL example src how to talk to your guyes system.. actualyl i am really trying to present CycL as a SQL server so your way you talk to MySQL atm .. you can talk to Cyc as well
23:06:01 <dmiles_afk> so there is some overlap the .. as long as both systems can meet both pretending they are MySQL servers
23:09:40 <iv_an_ru> I can't tell much about MySQL issues due to very simple reason. During last 7 years I forgot meny things about MySQL, Apache, tftpd, news servers and many other things.
23:10:18 <iv_an_ru> ...because it's so easy to install one Virtuoso instance and forget about coupling different applications together.
23:11:16 <dmiles_afk> becasue they designed it to work that way :0

23:14:13 <dmiles_afk> kit to decouple phpBB from MySQL such that is works with Virtuoso .. was that changing Virt or the PHPBB?
23:14:48 <iv_an_ru> re-link of PHPBB, I guess.
23:14:58 <dmiles_afk> i mean i read what he said.. but .. i guess i am thinking/hoping you just prettened your mysql
23:15:00 <dmiles_afk> ah
23:15:48 <dmiles_afk> it'd seem it shouldnt be that hard to write server drivers instead of client drivers
23:16:41 <iv_an_ru> Virtuoso is just ODBC or JDBC source for external applications. The re-linking is toinsert ODBC in the middle, and then it's easy to substitute one database with some other.
23:17:56 <dmiles_afk> ah.. so pretty much its replaceing myodbc with virtodbc
23:17:57 <iv_an_ru> A really big application will need finetuning anyway
23:18:05 <dmiles_afk> and not makiing PhpBB go nutty
23:18:12 <iv_an_ru> Not virtodbc. ODBC.
23:18:47 <lkagal> lkagal has joined #swig
23:19:15 <dmiles_afk> did Virt had to write a jdbc driver for all platforms?
23:19:17 <iv_an_ru> You don't have to connect solely to Virtuoso via ODBC, even if I'd recommend Virtuoso.
23:19:52 <`miguel> `miguel has quit
23:21:06 <iv_an_ru> Not for all, keeping in mind that we published up to 40 different builds per version :)
23:21:55 <iv_an_ru> But if there's a stable Java on a platform, why not have JDBC? :)
23:22:26 <dmiles_afk> ah.. i guess i just need to make sure i write an odbc driver for cyc (or probly not hard in java jdbc). and then virtuosa can talk to it?
23:22:34 <briansuda> briansuda has quit
23:22:42 <iv_an_ru> Of course.
23:24:29 <iv_an_ru> The main purpose of our middleware is to connect to different databases and place all of them into one huge distributed virtual schema
23:24:38 <dmiles_afk> ;P.. so then i could make SQARQL/Virtousa the front end and never have to write a SQARQL for cyc.. i just never thought about it... i just kept thinking i needed to bind a tcpsocket and figure how to talk like a sql server
23:25:10 <iv_an_ru> Precisely.
23:25:25 <dmiles_afk> are you trying to make cross server joins pleasant?
23:25:35 <iv_an_ru> Yes.
23:25:44 <dmiles_afk> meaning you spindle nicely for poorly written SQL?
23:26:10 <iv_an_ru> We have variety of optimizations specific for distributed schema.
23:26:49 <dmiles_afk> Cyc has a middleware componet to do that.. but its not mature for distributed schema. it'd be better to have something more concerned over that
23:28:13 <iv_an_ru> The main problen with distributed schemas is that there should be one box that distributes the query. Subqueries can not be delegated to remote boxes for further delegation.
23:28:40 <dmiles_afk> but the idea is you decribe the the schemes semantically and it will go out to all the right databases.. its just always a worse case expeentional  scenerio.. but if something pooled externally and made things work well thats nice
23:28:42 <iv_an_ru> There should be one head that calculates proper join order for whole query.
23:28:58 <dmiles_afk> right
23:30:16 <dmiles_afk> and doing complex SQARQL queiries you see the spreading .. everyhting takes time/trips to even know what the head is going to do in the end
23:30:27 <iv_an_ru> Additionally, we have tricks like automatic replacement of A join B on (A.X = F(B.Y)) with B join A on (B.Y = G(A.X)) if the server knows that F() and G() are inverse to each other.
23:30:48 <sheets> sheets has joined #swig
23:31:33 <dmiles_afk> i bet at times you can make "functions" like MotherOf(Bill) but never take i trip to get her until she is going to be someones binding.. in the end.. then you can make the trip
23:31:42 <iv_an_ru> The head is a full-scale RDBMS so it can create any desired number of temporary tables and join them in different ways.
23:32:00 <dmiles_afk> i trip/ the actually external trip

23:34:46 <dmiles_afk> how hard/$$ would it be to make Virtuso interface to a C++ video game that i present as triple store and make it write interesting queries?
23:35:15 <dmiles_afk> make it possible for *anbyone* (not it) to write queries
23:35:24 <iv_an_ru> There are problems related to lack of statistics about remote databases. Sometimes it would be better to start asking questions about mothers of all objects of some sort and cache answers before the head knows real names.
23:36:23 <iv_an_ru> So the game has a triple store inside?
23:36:30 <dmiles_afk> yeah.. people been trying to do stuff by resouce/time expenditure to make a good query.. but there probly are no right/wrong answers
23:36:47 <dmiles_afk> yes
23:37:07 <dmiles_afk> it reflects the state of all objects
23:38:20 <dmiles_afk> i was going to try to make it serve a dialect of SQL server so it could be talked to by  prexisiting SQL clients like phpBB/Cyc/Whater
23:39:06 <iv_an_ru> I'd say that the cheapest way is to move the triple store to Virtuoso. You may link Virtuoso as a shared object to your executable or you can turn the game into Virtuoso plugin.
23:39:11 <dmiles_afk> but i am presenting the same question as ealier but saying this is Virtosa problem instead of mine
23:39:38 <dmiles_afk> (oh, but the state cahanges whenever a player moves.)
23:39:58 <dmiles_afk> so the update would be virts cache is always invalid
23:41:19 <iv_an_ru> I'd suggest to place triples to DB.DBA.RDF_QUAD of Virtuoso and that's all, no need to cache something in application.
23:41:31 <dmiles_afk> i moved the triples over (i have each object with dirty mark) actually becasue of exacly what your saying.. (currently i am storing externally the same triple store) i am trying to find a way arround it
23:42:48 <lkagal> lkagal has quit
23:43:01 <iv_an_ru> Replacing one external storage with other (with Virtuoso) should be relatively cheap.
23:44:18 <dmiles_afk> totally.. i just want to put it somewahere everyone and everything can talk to
23:44:42 <iv_an_ru> Put it to Virtuoso :)
23:45:30 <dmiles_afk> 300mb ->  http://24.113.145.203/ExpandingAI.wmv the ssytem i am working on
23:46:02 <dmiles_afk> we just made that video of the game for AAAI
23:46:42 <iv_an_ru> Note that the game can be connected to Virtuoso not via plain ODBC but via so-called in-process client, when both client and server are actually inside same executable (so no IPC at all) but the interface remains the same as if they're in separate processes.
23:46:56 <dmiles_afk> when your playing it .. we have a java english to SQL in aiml scripts.. and i had to write little tcp workaround to do all this
23:48:55 <dmiles_afk> so i'd like to have a target for the Anglo/SQL .. right not i eval it in prolog that decides what dirrecton is appropriate
23:49:13 <dmiles_afk> noright not/right now
23:49:55 <dmiles_afk>  not via plain ODBC .. you mean i write a dirrect .. "i am a table" for Virt?
23:50:56 <dmiles_afk> "i am a table that is 3 columns wide"
23:51:07 <iv_an_ru> "I am a table" interface is prohibitively costly.
23:51:52 <dmiles_afk> costly in dollars to commision someone to do that level of work.. or slow access times?
23:52:14 <iv_an_ru> Costly in human-months.
23:53:58 <dmiles_afk> so actualyl just making the game present itslf as an odbc src to Virt is a good idea at least for a proof of concept stage? it'd get us familair with how this is done.. and the Virt is a rollerup option if everythting is made to be a driver?
23:54:51 <dmiles_afk> when both client and server are actually inside same executable (so no IPC at all) ... thats sounds differnt then what you said.. how is that differnt then "i am a table" ?
23:54:57 <iv_an_ru> ODBC 1.0 source is definitely cheaper than '"I'm a table" approach.
23:55:41 <iv_an_ru> Say, textbooks describes a lookup join of A and B as an object that travels A in outer loop, travels B in inner loop, applies filtering on join contion for every pair and returns hit after hit. Right?
23:55:42 <dmiles_afk> "thats sounds differnt then what you said" / "thats sounds differnt then what i just said about being a table"
23:56:24 <dmiles_afk> right thats a worse-case?
23:56:55 <iv_an_ru> "I'm the table" is the most costly case.
23:57:01 <dmiles_afk> erm the join happeing hit-after-hit
23:57:37 <iv_an_ru> In real life, the object A executes the rest of the query (filtering on B in this case)
23:57:56 <dmiles_afk> by avoiding IPC is that somewhere in the middle of costly vs cheap?
23:58:24 <iv_an_ru> Avoiding IPC cost nothing.
23:58:28 <dmiles_afk> ah, so you cant even start B until A instanciates
23:59:11 <iv_an_ru> Right. A does not return results to the caller. Instead it passes them to B for furher filtering.
23:59:31 <iv_an_ru> B sends final results to the caller's client.
23:59:36 <karlUshi> karlUshi has joined #swig
23:59:39 <dmiles_afk> oh so what you saying is the Virtuaosa is not just being used by the client driver they ship with it.. it is runing in an intance of the driver?

00:00:53 <iv_an_ru> Yes, in-process client can be described as a database server inside database driver.
00:01:46 <dmiles_afk> so A is tasking B with a job?
00:02:11 <dmiles_afk> and A is already forgot about it all?
00:02:57 <dmiles_afk> pretending A and B have their own servers becasuer they are distributed ;P
00:04:33 <dmiles_afk> i wonder if there is anything of further use A could send with its results o B doesnt have to call back
00:04:33 <iv_an_ru> query instance starts A, A starts B, B calls a routine that sendsone row of the result to somebody. Yes, if B should be executed on remote box then A will r-exec B
00:04:56 <bogonflux> bogonflux has joined #swig
00:06:08 <iv_an_ru> If B is remote then B will return result-set to, hm A1 that may cache them and/or additionally filter or reorder etc.
00:07:01 <dmiles_afk> i wondered about a query system that A,B,C all get the intial query... and then they can see the parts they'd be helpfull in filling in.. (if at all) and create a query cursor that was prefiltered
00:07:45 <dmiles_afk> then the recever of this info.. then starts the interation process after he examines it.. but i guess virtually most systems will work this way
00:09:03 <dmiles_afk> i mean if you just sort the smallest tables to the leftmost side.. and not even start the rigth-of table until its predicsor completes
00:09:13 <ndw> ndw has joined #swig
00:09:57 <dmiles_afk> turning the join to a best case senaro.. probly what iu said was the very first hearistic ever used
00:10:36 <iv_an_ru> If the host decides that there are data that can be prefetched from remotes then it's possible to load some remote boxes in parallel. Otherwise it may turn into sequence of cascading fetches.
00:12:40 <dmiles_afk> you heard of fluents before?  they are interative fetchers that only do work when someone looks at them.. this is every cell in the table. but the idea.. is you never have to keep arround a tree state.. or a backtrack state.. and there is no ordering
00:12:41 <iv_an_ru> Note that in addition to remote selects there are distributed updates that should be coordinated to guarantee that either all servers commit or all servers roll back.
00:13:03 <dmiles_afk> interative/iterative
00:13:49 <iv_an_ru> Databases can not work in PROLOG style. They had to work in DATALOG style.
00:14:29 <iv_an_ru> So no backtracking please, esp. on distributed net. Only finite point calculations.
00:14:59 <dmiles_afk> actually the fluent appoach was to workarround the depth first.. to not have to deal with backtracking.. but ah i though backtracking was a SQL issue as well

12:22:20 <bblfish> * bblfish Hi EliasT
12:22:28 <EliasT> hi
12:23:19 <bblfish> how's the SPARQL endpoint going?
12:24:24 <bblfish> I get HTTP Exeception: Not Implemented
12:24:33 <EliasT> ;-)
12:24:51 <EliasT> we disable it because we are getting a lot of cpu usage
12:25:11 <bblfish> ah. What were people doing with it?
12:25:14 <bblfish> trying to kill it?
12:25:25 <bblfish> or just asking really complex queries?
12:25:54 <EliasT> checking the logs but I think it's more a bug on our side.
12:26:39 <bblfish> oh. Query end points will always need to be well protected. SPARQL end points will need to be able to limit cpu consumption per query in one way or another
12:27:21 <EliasT> yes, but our problem is before that, it's on our side.
12:27:37 <bblfish> did you see my post on graphs?
12:28:37 <EliasT> yes
12:29:22 <EliasT> I don't know why you are too surprised with the GRAPH ?g syntax.
12:30:10 <EliasT> This is just how we surfaced it now in order to be able to show how they are being stored
12:30:24 <EliasT> however, in a SPARQL query engine you decide how do you specify the dataset.
12:30:35 <EliasT> everything could be "merged" in the default graph.
12:30:53 <EliasT> or be available as both default and named graph for when you need context.
12:31:08 <bblfish> I am not surprised that there are graphs. The way you have done it is cool in fact. More that one needs to go through graphs to query the engine.
12:31:47 <bblfish> yes. I think a default graph that merged everything would be nice
12:32:08 <bblfish> It would make it easier to query things, I think
12:32:20 <EliasT> well it depends.. because of the merge issues.
12:32:36 <bblfish> but you are completely in control of the data
12:32:40 <kingsleyidehen> kingsleyidehen has joined #swig
12:32:55 <bblfish> I can see that merging rdf graphs inside atom: content could be dangerous
12:33:19 <EliasT> forget what I said.. merging is not a problem unless you try to do smushing.
12:33:28 <bblfish> Ie if someone posted an entry with RDF in the content
12:33:38 <bblfish> that could be a problem
12:34:24 <bblfish> because your atom server is not verifying that content when adding it
12:35:00 <EliasT> what do you mean?
12:35:42 <bblfish> or in other words: whenever you POST, PUT, DELETE, etc a (new) entry your server does consistency checks (the id cannot be one used somewhere else for example)
12:35:54 <EliasT> which id?
12:35:59 <bblfish> atom:id
12:36:04 <EliasT> [] atom:id "id";
12:36:08 <EliasT> I do that.
12:36:16 <EliasT> that's the only thing I need to check
12:36:22 <EliasT> everyone else has their own bnode for the entry.
12:36:39 <dmiles_afk> dmiles_afk has joined #swig
12:36:45 <EliasT> if you try to change your id from what's specified in the URI (aka. NG) I throw an exception.
12:36:54 <bblfish> yes. So there is some consistency check going on there. You also place the files in the right place, and do a few things like create alternate representations perhaps
12:37:08 <EliasT> yes
12:37:23 <bblfish> but if someone puts a content with some rdf in there... like this
12:38:18 <EliasT> an RDF Atom entry inside an Atom entry.
12:38:42 <bblfish> [ a :Entry; :id "id"^^xsd:anyUri; :content [ :body "[ a :Entry; :id "id"^^xsd:anyUri; content "hello" ]" ] .
12:39:08 <EliasT> right.
12:39:15 <EliasT> but that's also only 1 check, right?
12:39:29 <EliasT> to avoid the IFP or CIFP to make two things equal?
12:39:37 <bblfish> now one of your colleagues wrote a blog saying that he interpreted the content of the body and added it to the rdf database
12:39:56 <EliasT> yes
12:39:57 <EliasT> RDFa
12:40:23 <EliasT> N3,RDF/XML later.
12:40:24 <bblfish> yes. Well I am wondering there if that could not mess things up for the database
12:40:34 <EliasT> inside 1 named graph
12:40:43 <EliasT> that has a different type.
12:41:00 <EliasT> type content.
12:41:05 <bblfish> yes: if you keep that data in a named graph and don't merge it then everything's ok
12:41:10 <evanpro> evanpro has joined #swig
12:41:14 <EliasT> that's why ;-)
12:41:39 <EliasT> vhvhvchkckcjchj
12:41:44 <bblfish> ?
12:41:49 <EliasT> * EliasT 's son like #swig
12:41:58 <bblfish> oh :-)
12:42:12 <EliasT>  **** NoahT has joined #swig
12:42:36 <EliasT> * EliasT has a meeting at 9EST, ttyl.
12:43:37 <bblfish> ok. This is an interesting discussion. How should one merge stuff inside the content. Perhaps by creating a global "content" graph that would merge all or some of the contents...
12:46:17 <EliasT> not really. we are thinking more like a graph for each entry's content.
12:48:03 <chimezie> chimezie has joined #swig
12:48:36 <bblfish> yes. Btw that is what I was proposing a year ago: that a Content be a graph...
12:48:59 <bblfish> never quite worked it out. I was wondering what one should do if someone posted DOAP content
12:49:13 <EliasT> that's its own graph
12:49:18 <phenny> phenny has joined #swig
12:50:28 <proyal> proyal has joined #swig
12:51:26 <bblfish> Now if content is its own graph, then it starts to look like atom is a vocabulary for describing graphs...
12:51:39 <bblfish> just a thought
12:52:23 <EliasT> well it is right? atom:link ?
12:52:42 <iv_an_ru> iv_an_ru has quit
12:52:49 <bblfish> heh. yes it does look more like it now
12:53:03 <bblfish> (than it did a year ago when I was not so clear)
12:54:07 <bblfish> So I suppose someone could construct a graph that would merge all graphs that are DOAP files and then query that
12:54:43 <bblfish> I need to play with SPARQL more to see how that works out.

14:59:55 <bblfish> hi, just to come back to a question I had yesterday...
15:00:26 <bblfish> If I have something like
15:00:27 <bblfish> <link rel="categories" href="/cats"/>
15:00:40 <bblfish> which I translate into
15:01:00 <bblfish> [ iana:categories </cats> .
15:01:21 <bblfish> where
15:01:21 <bblfish> @prefix iana: <http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/> .
15:01:21 <bblfish> @prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .
15:01:21 <bblfish> @prefix owl: <http://www.w3.org/2002/07/owl#> .
15:01:21 <bblfish> iana:categories a owl:DatatypePropery;
15:01:22 <bblfish>                 rdfs:domain :FeedOrEntry;
15:01:24 <bblfish>                 rdfs:range :CategoryList .
15:02:09 <dsheets> dsheets has joined #swig
15:02:39 <bblfish> is it ok to expect the :CategoryList resource to serve its categories using a certain ontology when queried using the application/rdf+xml format?
15:03:29 <bblfish> Perhaps this is as yet still undefined
15:04:07 <bblfish> perhaps I'll send that to swig.

15:18:16 <chimezie> auwts: i'm back.. it was on my plate but the current N3 parser (n3p) handles that by default, so there isn't really much of a need
15:20:16 <chimezie> bblfish: if iana:categories is a DatatypeProperty, it's range should be a datatype/literal
15:21:32 <chimezie> and it's okay for a URL to respond to GET with accept headers in any way appropriate - in this case, if the ontology is expressed in rdf/xml then it would make sense for it to respond this way to such a request

16:17:22 <LeeF> bblfish: I don't think MIME type is an appropriate way to solve the problem of receiving an expected vocabulary. The vocabulary received is a contract between the requester and responder, and that contract can be a convention or specified in some sort of out-of-band application-specific manner (or some as of yet non-existent standard fashion), but MIME type's not the right way, IMO.

17:02:49 <bblfish> LeeF: just saw your point about mime types. I agree. Indeed this is what I have been arguing on the atom mailing list. http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg05897.html
17:03:25 <iwaim_> iwaim_ has joined #swig
17:04:09 <chimezie> bblfish: the convention you are using (in AtomOWL) of assigning URLs to mime-types, whats the specific mapping, and is there a registry that must be synched with?
17:04:39 <EliasT> chimezie, http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/
17:04:43 <chimezie> i.e., is there enough infrastructure to support mime-types as URIs (sorry, not URLs) instead of strings
17:04:55 <brick> brick has joined #swig
17:05:04 <EliasT> we just stumble upon that and figured it was worth a try.
17:05:09 <chimezie> ahh..
17:05:13 <peter_KC_> peter_KC_ has joined #swig
17:05:24 <beobal> beobal has quit
17:05:36 <EliasT> it won't support parameters with a transformation.
17:05:48 <EliasT> s/with/without/
17:07:56 <chimezie> seems (generally) to be alot of value in associating mime-types with resources in RDF to capture transport-level semantics
17:08:16 <EliasT> I think so too.
17:11:07 <iand> iand has joined #swig
17:11:34 <bblfish> I am not sure the latest ontology still does this
17:11:56 <bblfish> Well I don't think I associate urls with mime types. It's just a string at present
17:12:03 <danja> danja has quit
17:12:21 <EliasT> right, because we never got support.
17:12:26 <bblfish> the iana:alternate are relations that atom has registered for its own use
17:12:30 <EliasT> besides bblfish and I.
17:12:57 <EliasT> of course, as a QName that is.
17:12:57 <bblfish> :-) yes. We just need more people to get interested in atomowl for voting to make sense
17:13:30 <EliasT> well.. many are using it as we are finding out... but not many are helping on the mailing list.
17:13:53 <d2m> d2m has joined #swig
17:14:51 <bblfish> ah yes. It would be great if iana put up a document in rdf at that url http://www.iana.org/assignments/relation/alternate
17:16:02 <bblfish> in the end though we will have to see if that is strictly something we can do. It makes sense though.
17:16:27 <bblfish> anyway, the recent discussion on mime types on the atom list are really quite eye opening.
17:17:08 <bblfish> James Snell is even arguing that one should have had one mime type for atom:entry documents and another for atom:feed documents
17:17:20 <bblfish> Then one for atom:categories documents
17:17:27 <bblfish> and one for cats I suppose
17:17:28 <bblfish> and dogs
17:17:33 <bblfish> and cat parts
17:17:36 <bblfish> crazy
17:17:44 <Mutiny> Mutiny has quit
17:20:50 <bblfish> (tough perhaps James is not so much arguing as trying to prod people into seeing the foolishness of tying mime types so closely to data formats)
17:22:04 <chimezie> * chimezie wishes he had more time to contribute to atom/owl
17:23:54 <brick> brick has quit
17:23:54 <chimezie> well, the number of distinct digital representations is pretty much infinite so it's hard to manage them in a universal way
17:24:27 <EliasT> chimezie, you are excused because you work on other stuff for the good of other people too.
17:24:28 <DanC_lap> DanC_lap has joined #swig
17:24:46 <evlist> evlist has quit
17:25:06 <bblfish> well perhaps the trick would be to have an HTTP header pointing to an relax-ng url
17:25:27 <bblfish> or to some document that stateted the type of info in the representation.

17:30:15 <LeeF> X-Ontology-Accept:
17:31:29 <bblfish> something like that :-)
17:32:23 <evan_> evan_ is now known as evanpro
17:32:44 <chimezie> a) accept-header: application/rdf+xml,text/rdf+n3 b) SELECT ?definingOnt WHERE {  [ rdfs:isDefinedBy ?definingOnt ] }
17:33:22 <schepers> schepers has joined #swig
17:34:06 <chimezie> that should be SELECT DISTINCT ?definingOnt
17:34:28 <bblfish> I don't understand b)
17:34:32 <bblfish> where would that go?
17:34:59 <chimezie> to the URL the mime-type describes
17:35:26 <chimezie> or maybe i misunderstood what you had in mind
17:35:27 <bblfish> you mean SELECT ?url WHERE { ?url rdfs:usDefinedBy <someOnt> }
17:36:07 <bblfish> ah ok
17:36:55 <bblfish> so you would have mime types that are URLS, and at the end of those URLS are SPARQL end points?
17:38:18 <chimezie> oh i see, where our disconnect is, you were referring to the mime-type registry not an arbitrary URL
17:39:17 <PhUrl> hi all
17:39:40 <PhUrl> how can i create a property in owl to use with pellet that is treated just like the rdf:type predicate?
17:39:50 <bblfish> I sent a mail to the swig mailing list, probably easier to discuss this on that type of forum

20:57:17 <edrx> is it possible to use typemaps to create new "primitive" types, like int? I just read the section "string encoding of types" in the "Extending Swig" section of the manual...
20:57:32 <ignoti_et_quasi_> ignoti_et_quasi_ has joined #swig
20:58:34 <edrx> actually I'm a newcomer to swig - I'm trying to find a way to have C functions that malloc a region of memory and then return that region (a pointer + a length) as a Lua string...
20:59:35 <edrx> my idea was to use a typemap and something like
20:59:39 <edrx> %typemap(out) lstring %{ lua_pushlstring(L, $1.ptr, $1.len); free($1.ptr); %}
20:59:44 <EliasT> EliasT has left #swig
21:00:39 <chimezie> edrx: you are in the wrong channel, see the topic
21:00:52 <edrx> but to make things cleaner I'd like to tell swig to not look inside lstrings and do not provide accessor functions

08:32:20 <danja> See http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2006-07-22#T08-32-20
08:33:40 <danja> I'd like to suggest another term for the data-view vocab
08:35:26 <danja> well, not sure of how to express it yet - be able to say that the result of a transformation are non-authoratative
08:36:09 <danja> it came up when trying to put together a microformat/grddl demo
08:36:22 <danja> hardly any instance data has a profile
08:37:50 <danja> so what I'd like to be able to say is that this RDF was made on the assumption that e.g. including a class="vcard" in a doc meant the hcard profile was to be used
08:39:01 <danja> so a processing chain might be:
08:39:22 <danja> html -> tidy -> xhtml
08:40:06 <danja> xhtml -> for every well-known class attribute, insert a corresponding profile attribute -> xhtml
08:40:28 <danja> xhtml -> xslt -> rdf/xml
08:41:10 <danja> rdf/xml -> add a triple stating this is non-authoratitive -> RDF
08:41:42 <danja> or somesuch (maybe the xslt could be parameterised?)
08:43:13 <danja> phenny, tell DanC check http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2006-07-22#T08-32-20 re. GRDDL when it's scraped
08:43:15 <phenny> danja: I'll pass that on when danc is around.
08:47:07 <danja> oh yeah - the transformation could probably be expressed using existing terms, but that still doesn't offer a neat way of saying "but perhaps the publisher didn't actually mean this"

16:39:51 <bblfish> hello
16:43:56 <bblfish> I was just wondering if anyone had any opionions about the post I sent to the mailing list http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2006Jul/0062
16:45:04 <sbp> bblfish: yeah, you seem to be overlooking the fact that MIME types describe syntax not semantics
16:45:29 <sbp> for example, PNG and GIF are basically interchangable, but they have different MIME types
16:45:55 <sbp> so saying "well, I can express PNG in RDF!!" doesn't really change anything
16:45:57 <danja> danja has quit
16:46:01 <bblfish> yes. I understand that. I am surprised it looks like I am making that mistake in my post
16:46:15 <sbp> okay, I appear to have gravely misunderstood your post
16:46:24 <sbp> could you possibly explain more?
16:47:03 <bblfish> I am imagining a world where we use atom-owl instead of atom xml ;-)
16:47:28 <sbp> would that such a world existed
16:47:50 <bblfish> and we serve an entry document with a "categories" link
16:47:55 <bblfish> in N3 this would be:
16:47:56 <bblfish> [] a :Entry;
16:47:57 <bblfish>    iana:categories </cats> .
16:48:26 <sbp> okay
16:50:09 <bblfish> ok so that tells us that this </cats> document is a :CategoryList .
16:50:09 <bblfish> So we would expect to get this
16:50:10 <bblfish> <> a :CategoryList;
16:50:12 <bblfish>     :category [ :scheme <http://eg.com/cats/>;
16:50:14 <bblfish>                 :term "dog" ];
16:50:16 <bblfish>     :category [ :scheme <http://eg.com/cats/>;
16:50:18 <bblfish>                 :term "house" ].
16:50:20 <bblfish> when we ask for its N3 representation
16:50:22 <bblfish> but instead we get
16:50:26 <bblfish> <> a :McDonaldCategoryList;
16:50:28 <bblfish>     :McCategory [ :McScheme <http://eg.com/cats/>;
16:50:30 <bblfish>                 :McTerm "dog" ];
16:50:32 <bblfish>     :McCategory [ :McScheme <http://eg.com/cats/>;
16:50:34 <bblfish>                 :McTerm "house" ].
16:50:36 <bblfish> can we say that this is wrong?
16:50:40 <bblfish> (we imagine that somewhere it is defined that :category owl:sameAs :McCategory
16:50:48 <bblfish> does that make sense?
16:51:02 <sbp> you can't say it's inconsistent if you don't know that, no
16:51:18 <sbp> you say that the range of iana:categories is :CategoryList, I understand
16:51:31 <sbp> and you find that you have new information saying that actually, </cats> is :McDonaldCategoryList
16:51:36 <sbp> so now you know it's both
16:52:01 <sbp> so one thing you can infer from that is that </cats> is in the intersection of :CategoryList and :McDonaldCategoryList
16:52:03 <bblfish> that's true :-)
16:52:20 <sbp> you can't know from just the information that you have that they're the same class, though you can't rule that out too
16:52:45 <sbp> the only way that an inconsistency could come up is if :CategoryList and :McDonaldCategoryList are said, in some new information, to be disjoint classes
16:52:59 <sbp> i.e. that they have no intersection
16:53:14 <bblfish> ok. good.
16:53:26 <sbp> so... how does this relate to MIME type explosion?
16:54:14 <bblfish> well clearly rdf avoids the mime type explosion, since we can create all kinds of docs about everything in the universe and we don't need a new mime type for each
16:54:46 <sbp> oh I see the problem that you're getting at
16:55:02 <sbp> one place where this has come up before is defining what a "FOAF" document is
16:55:02 <bblfish> but the mime type fanatics will say (on the atom pub list) that you may know something is N3 but you don't necessarily know the vocab used in there
16:55:15 <sbp> right. but there are possibilities in the area
16:55:18 <bblfish> ah yes. I heard that
16:56:06 <sbp> it's possible to come up with some rules that create document classes, somewhat like how XML Schema and RELAX NG create classes of XML documents of which we call instances "valid documents" according to those schemata
16:56:40 <sbp> you could do a similar thing by saying, using a trivial example, that if a document has a single * foaf:* * triple in it, then it's a FOAF document. a naive FOAF document class
16:57:00 <bblfish> makes sense to me.
16:57:05 <bblfish> No black magic.
16:57:13 <sbp> yeah, me too, and it's tied in strongly to the realm of query and of schemata
16:57:22 <sbp> but sadly, not very much work has been conducted in the area that I know of
16:57:49 <bblfish>  you know it would be good if someone kindof gave a short answer like that, pointing out one possibility, so that I can point to the anwswer... well I suppose I can point to the answer here too :-)
16:57:54 <sbp> I first tried to do this sort of thing for EARL, back in 2001, but I didn't really know what I was doing and when I asked other people about the approach they just sorta blanked me
16:58:05 <sbp> in 2003 I wrote a brief note about it, but again, nobody really said much
16:58:14 <sbp> yeah
16:58:18 <sbp> well, I wrote this:
16:58:20 <sbp> .g GraphSL
16:58:22 <phenny> sbp: http://infomesh.net/2003/graphsl
16:58:33 <sbp> which is not particularly clear, but might be better than nothing, I dunno
16:59:24 <bblfish> well it is a proof of concept, that something like this is possible.
16:59:25 <sbp> there may have been independent work on the subject that I've missed
16:59:33 <sbp> yes, and also...
17:00:11 <sbp> DanC has done some projects about expressing XML in RDF, and I was interested in modelling XML validation in RDF
17:00:37 <sbp> which is very strongly related, of course. it'd make sense to model RDF document classes before modelling XML document classes though!
17:01:22 <bblfish> yes.
17:01:37 <bblfish> This is going to help me answer the last paragraph of this: http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg05901.html
17:03:59 <sbp> ah yes
17:04:06 <sbp> another strongly related area is profiling in XHTML
17:04:47 <bblfish> just looking at graphsl
17:04:49 <sbp> XHTML Modularization, which got me interested in web architecture back in 2000, is supposedly a way to be able to create subsets and supersets of the various XHTML langauges (1.0, 1.1, Basic...) for your own purposes
17:05:17 <JibberJim> chortle!
17:05:45 <sbp> to the extent where they're thinking about, and perhaps have already implemented, a "profile" attribute for the XHTML MIME type, so you'd be able to do Content-Type: application/xhtml+xml; profile=http://example.org/ to show which profile of XHTML you're using
17:06:10 <sbp> but, as JibberJim says, chortle. m12n... well it's taken me six years to find a comfortable and useful approach to modularising XHTML
17:06:31 <sbp> and that approach is to use RELAX NG, with the content model autogenerated from the XHTML DTDs
17:06:59 <sbp> the benefits of the RELAX NG approach are 1) I can use it in nxml-mode, and 2) I can easily validate lots of *.html on my hard drive with rnv or jing
17:07:29 <sbp> so anyway, that's a good illustration of the advantages and the problems that you can encounter when trying to make a good profiling/modularisation language
17:07:42 <bblfish> thanks :-)
17:07:48 <sbp> you're welcome!
17:09:40 <bblfish> ah so the idea is one could use somethink like profile for N3?
17:09:46 <sbp> * sbp reads GraphSL again, remembers that a good example of how to do profiling badly in RDF is to make a canonicalised subset of the RDF/XML representation of some ontology: bad because then you have to encode the knowledge of that in tools that produce it!
17:10:20 <sbp> bblfish: sure, good idea. where the URI given is the URI of a document class that the N3 conforms to semantically
17:10:45 <sbp> I like the profile= MIME type attribute idea personally, but there might be problems with it
17:11:30 <bblfish> Ok well I'll point the mail on the mailing list to what was written here...
17:11:37 <sbp> also, remember to start with a requirement and use cases; why is profile= useful?
17:11:50 <sbp> okay
17:13:10 <bblfish> in foaf is the resource the FoafDocument or is the representation the FoafDocument?
17:13:14 <sbp> hmm, one problem with the GraphSL proposal is that the syntax is so unwieldy. using a SPARQL based language might be much better, but I guess this is related to why RNC in much easier to author and read than RNG
17:13:57 <sbp> bblfish: the representation, but only because when you parse the representation according to the semantics of its mime type then the resulting triples are such that they conform to the FoafDocument document class
17:14:10 <sbp> think of it as being pretty much directly analagous to XML validation
17:14:33 <sbp> to know if an XML document is valid, you have to parse it to construct an infoset from it first
17:14:39 <sbp> thne you validate the infoset
17:14:53 <sbp> with RDF, you parse it to its component triples first
17:14:56 <sbp> then validate those triples
17:15:47 <bblfish> I think this will clearly be very important.
17:15:47 <bblfish> One needs to be able to state what types of statements or relations are available in a graph
17:15:55 <sbp> (and, O frabjuous joy!, since you can express the XML infoset in RDF, this RDF validation technique can probably be seen as a superset of XML validation)
17:16:10 <sbp> yeah, well I thought it would be important too
17:16:21 <bblfish> :-)
17:16:21 <sbp> but in six years of Semantic Web development, I've seen nary a peep over it
17:17:05 <sbp> only in confused threads like the "what makes a FOAF document tick?" thing, which tends to just make people waffle at one another for a bit and then forget the problem because there are no practical implications
17:17:37 <sbp> but yeah, I think it's important for the same reason that XML validation is important
17:17:45 <sbp> and for the same reason that OWL consistency checking is important
17:18:29 <sbp> because being able to create profiles means that you can focus on the important things, and lets you check the integrity of your data. I think profiling is important because it lets you create a *minimal* definition for the language that you're actually using
17:19:01 <bblfish> should one say <http://me.org/foaf.n3> a foaf:Document. or is is <http://me.org/foaf.n3> a foaf:DocumentProducingResource
17:19:09 <sbp> so, for example, I never use <i> in HTML. so I don't have that in my RELAX NG Compact schema for the XHTML that I use. it's descriptive
17:19:44 <sbp> hmm, good question. I suppose you have to deal with the whole conneg issue
17:20:21 <sbp> well...
17:20:28 <sbp> another way to do it that sidesteps the issue...
17:20:48 <sbp> is consider this: usually, schemas are documented in files, right? so you have xhtml1.dtd, or docbook.xsd, or something.rnc
17:20:56 <sbp> so you might have something like:
17:21:23 <sbp> <http://me.org/foaf.n3> graph:schema <http://example.org/foafdocument.n3> .
17:22:09 <sbp> where foafdocument.n3 contains a definition of foaf:Document, and itself conforms to something like graph:Schema. this is all getting a bit abstract, but I hope you follow
17:22:52 <sbp> foafdocument.n3 would conform to the graph:Schema class in the same way that XML Schema documents conform to the XML Schema for XML Schema, xsd.xsd. there is such a horrible beast
17:23:45 <sbp> so { ?x graph:schema ?y } => { ?y graph:schema <http://graphschema.org/schema.rdf> } .
17:23:56 <sbp> to once again sidestep that whole resource vs. representation issue
17:25:03 <sbp> all this is further complicated by the fact that there is already an RDF Schema, which enforces its own consistency checks, but very mild ones
17:25:32 <sbp> perhaps calling these things "profiles" would be less confusing (ha)
17:25:52 <bblfish> ok. Makes sense to me. The devil is working out the details.
17:25:53 <sbp> BLURB:Schema Languages for RDF
17:25:56 <sbp> right
17:26:03 <sbp> no BLURB? no chump?
17:26:09 <sbp> http://example.org/
17:26:12 <sbp> no chump, okay
17:27:15 <rreck> rreck has joined #swig
17:27:18 <bblfish> My guess is that this has not been a problem until now, because most people are assuming what types of rdf documents are at the other end. And it works out ok. But this will certainly be a useful too. Especially if you want to define protocols
17:27:41 <bblfish> Ok. Got to go. Thanks for the help

21:09:43 <jargonjustin> I have a question about the RDF Schema semantics.  As I understand it, rdfs:Resource is of rdf:type rdfs:Class, but rdfs:Class is a subclass of rdfs:Resource, how does this work?
21:12:23 <mzeltner> Aren't nodes and literals subclasses of rdfs:Resource too?

21:30:17 <mzeltner> jargonjustin: http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2006-07-22.html#T21-09-43
21:30:37 <jargonjustin> jargonjustin has quit
21:30:39 <mzeltner> Whoops, jargonjustin_ that should've been
21:31:01 <jargonjustin_> mzeltner: Thanks.
21:32:19 <mzeltner> So, are you asking about the concepts behind that or how to implement that into an application?
21:33:19 <mzeltner> Because … http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-schema/#ch_resource
21:33:29 <peace-kee> peace-kee has left #swig
21:33:43 <jargonjustin_> mzeltner: The concepts, I'm just trying to understand it.
21:35:35 <jargonjustin_> jargonjustin_ has quit
21:35:41 <jargonjustin> jargonjustin has joined #swig
21:36:25 <mzeltner> jargonjustin: Since it's the base, you need to somehow express that it is
21:37:00 <jargonjustin> So rdfs:Class is an instance of rdfs:Class, which is in turn a subclass of rdfs:Resource (all classes are resources) which is itself a class?
21:37:02 <mzeltner> rdfs:Class is an rdfs:Class too - defines itself
21:37:06 <jargonjustin> Okay, that makes sense actually.
21:37:31 <jargonjustin> The circular relationship with the subclass threw me off, thanks.
21:37:55 <mzeltner> :)
21:38:15 <jargonjustin> Also, as far as RDF/XML goes, is it possible or good-practice to specify an xml:base for a document with relative ID references (either rdf:ID or fragment identifiers)?
21:38:39 <bitsko> bitsko has quit
21:39:06 <mzeltner> I wonder if there is any good-practice in RDF/XML *snicker*
21:40:30 <jargonjustin> mzeltner: Heh, well, I'm just thinking that if you publish a schema via HTTP somewhere and it gets saved to disk, having xml:base specified should allow a processor to determine the full qualified URI for referenced resources... if RDF/XML requires processors to support xml:base.
21:40:30 <mzeltner> I haven't seen it used very much, but yes it should be possible
21:40:59 <jargonjustin> Ah, found what I'm looking for: http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-syntax-grammar/#section-Syntax-ID-xml-base
21:41:15 <mzeltner> Was just about to give you that link :)
21:44:45 <jargonjustin> As far as experimenting with RDF processors, is Redland considered a good implementation to start with?
21:45:19 <mzeltner> Very good I'd say
21:45:19 <idf> its pretty much the only one you can start with, unless you want to install JAVA
21:45:28 <idf> at least, its the only one in Portage. and it also is quite good - language bindings for everything
21:45:39 <mzeltner> There's RDFLib if you're into Python
21:45:44 <idf> yeah, Pyrple
21:45:58 <jargonjustin> idf: I'm mainly looking at it for the bindings since Python is the only language with other implementations it seems.

17:56:57 <jargonjustin_> Is there a reason the SPARQL HTTP protocol binds the QueryRequestRefused fault to HTTP 500?  Shouldn't it be 403?
17:59:48 <jargonjustin_> Actually, HTTP 406 looks like a closer match to the way the fault is defined.

19:38:11 <ericP> jargonjustin_, you can send a comment to public-rdf-dawg-comments@w3.org
19:38:43 <grove> grove has joined #swig
19:39:28 <ericP> jargonjustin_, is your thinking that the HTTP request succeeded even though the service implied by the request failed?
19:47:38 <jargonjustin_> ericP: Yes, since the error isn't necessarily internal to the server.  A 403 would work best except that the HTTP spec says that same request should not be repeated and the SPARQL fault description says it's unspecified.
19:48:14 <jargonjustin_> A 500 error implies that something went wrong internal, which isn't the same as refusing to process the request.
19:50:13 <ericP> jargonjustin_, i wonder if we can find any wisdom in the web services world
19:50:39 <Biblio-> a newbie question? does the protocol need to consider also permissions and the ability to sinchronize netween data stores?
19:50:53 <ericP> that is, what does the WSDL spec say about this, or what is best practice for SOAP requests...
19:51:17 <jargonjustin_> Reading the description of the fault in the spec actually seems appropriate and well-written, but the provided WSDL maps it to a 500 response code, which doesn't seem correct.
19:52:03 <jargonjustin_> Biblio-: It's a query protocol, the scope is only to define an interface.  It also includes an HTTP (REST) based recommendation and a SOAP binding.
19:52:32 <ericP> Biblio-, do you mean, should the SPARQL protocol give errors if the backing service will not be able to access the relevent data stores?
19:53:28 <jargonjustin_> ericP: The WSDL isn't going to define a best practice for something like this, it's more of an HTTP question.
19:53:35 <Biblio-> jargonjustin...if there will be data stores talking to each other...then where, or at what level someone is going to check that a person has access or not to one of them, or to some content in it?
19:53:36 <jargonjustin_> s/WSDL/WSDL spec/
19:54:10 <Biblio-> and is the functionality for data store to data store synchronization considered as well?
19:54:25 <jargonjustin_> Biblio-: If you were using HTTP, you could use the builtin authentication mechanisms (RFC 2617) and SOAP headers have great security protocols as is.
19:55:25 <jargonjustin_> There's been some work in using WSSE authentication designed for SOAP requests over HTTP by the Atom WG, so you could probably use the same system for both.
19:55:48 <evanpro> evanpro has quit
19:55:53 <Biblio-> jargonjustin, i see, thanks.
19:59:58 <Biblio-> a secondary newbioe question...formerly, most permissions worked with the assumption of a hierarchy of files and directories. but if data stores show to end users just datastructures (people, emails, recipes...) does that affect the permissions model?
20:01:00 <Biblio-> should we worry about that even at protocol level?
20:02:01 <ericP> jargonjustin_, re HTTP question, it's an HTTP question that affects every WSDL-described service
20:02:32 <ericP> HTTP error codes are still pretty much geared towards your browswer or similar app
20:03:42 <ericP> web service developers need different error code text to guide how they feed back higher level errors to the transport (transfer, really) layer
20:11:07 <ericP> Biblio-, can you produce a use case where the permissions model would affect your use of HTTP error codes?
20:11:46 <Biblio-> ericp, to be fair...probably not, since i'm just a newbie.
20:12:08 <ericP> HTTP error codes don't include info like "if you go up two directories, you will be allowed to GET an index"
20:13:07 <ericP> so i suspect, without having looked hard for screw cases, that your permissions model will not affect your use of HTTP
20:13:30 <Biblio-> ericp, sounds reasonable at first glance, yes.
20:13:35 <ericP> interesting question, though
20:14:34 <Wikier> Wikier has joined #swig
20:14:37 <larsbot> larsbot has joined #swig
20:14:54 <Biblio-> ericp, i wonder if anyone is seriously thinking about what happens when former paradigms get changed
20:15:35 <Biblio-> something similar happen with url's, btw. url's are also directory based
20:15:44 <Biblio-> hierarchical
20:15:51 <ericP> only a little bit
20:16:00 <ericP> that is, only to parse . and ..
20:16:53 <ericP> other than that, there is no relationship between http://example.com/letstalkaboutme/ and http://example.com/letstalkaboutme/dirtysecrets/
20:18:06 <Biblio-> if someone wants to get to some content...why not to use some label  as a link to it, regardless of where in a hierarchy the content is stored?
20:18:32 <ericP> the only functionality i would lose of i spelled that http://example.com/letstalkaboutme~dirtysecrets~ would be that relative URIs would be relative to /
20:19:41 <ericP> Biblio-, most web browsers default to, in the absense of other advice, looking relative to some ServerRoot (Apache term)
20:20:16 <ericP> but there are lots of URI resolvers in HTTP servers that does some extra level of indirection
20:20:29 <Biblio-> that sounds better, but still bound to at least the root dir
20:21:14 <ericP> CGI services like http://example.com/scripts/annotations/annotation-234234/
20:22:02 <ericP> www.w3.org uses an apache module that looks up URLs in a gdbm and finds out a (probably different) location for them
20:24:06 <Kriegel> Kriegel has quit
20:26:55 <Biblio-> could some global, web wide system be implemented so that we could link to dome content not by specifying an adress, but by specifying a label, a name for the content? if so, people could move content in servers, even to different servers, and resources could still be found.
20:27:39 <Biblio-> does that meke sense?
20:32:45 <evamen> evamen has joined #SWIG
20:43:13 <Biblio-> if i install a data store in my local machine, than i do not care anymore where a particular content is physically stored. i can access it by searching for it's label, not by looking for an adress. could the same be done globally?
20:44:44 <ericP> Biblio-, p2p systems do something like that
20:45:10 <ericP> also, people periodically invent new URL schemes to do stuff like that
20:45:49 <ericP> the prob is that, ultimately, these get inefficient, and end up introducing the same resolution probs we have now
20:46:45 <Biblio-> erip, what kind of problems would that have?
20:47:47 <Biblio-> (my motivation for this is that end-users could get rid totally of the physical storing layer, and move just toa purely logical (not physical) level)
20:47:47 <ericP> i'm trying to recall the name of the URI scheme proposed by some bio-rdf geeks
20:48:09 <Biblio-> very active, that bio people
20:48:27 <ericP> they give names for things, and you configure your local resolver to ask some repository for it
20:48:44 <Biblio-> yep, that's the idea.
20:48:48 <ericP> basically, an extra level of indirection
20:49:32 <Biblio-> ericp, true. but it allows all end-users to forget the physical level, and move just in the logical
20:49:38 <ericP> the prob is that distributing the names of resolvers is essentially an unsolved problem
20:50:08 <Biblio-> ericp, i see.
20:50:22 <ericP> the the resistance to shifts in the DNS is no more than you find in HTTP URL schemes
20:50:47 <ericP> plus, you lose the nice social affect of poeple knowing when they are stepping on someone else's name
20:51:18 <ericP> (which make a machine-processable web essentially untrustable)
20:51:43 <Wikier> Wikier has quit
20:52:14 <evamen> evamen has left #SWIG
20:52:18 <ericP> right now, if i mint a URL, say http://plugmatch.com/NGK/8201, i am confident that noone else as used that name for a slightly different meaning
20:52:39 <Biblio-> if we used labels, we could have collisions
20:52:55 <ericP> why? because i have a relationship with the owners and other contributors to plugmatch.com and i can see the file there
20:53:09 <ericP> ahh, appears you see what i mean
20:53:19 <Biblio-> i think i do, yes, thanks
20:53:54 <ericP> the best systems to my mind is to establish a relationship with some folks who will archive your data
20:53:54 <Biblio-> but ericp...i casn not but help to think it is still a very worthy goal. and that some sort of conflict resolkution could be achieved
20:54:28 <ericP> w3 has contracts with MIT libararies and a few other upstart archivists to serve www.w3.org in perpetuity
20:55:56 <ericP> when we all get on a plane to the same place, crash in the andes and end up eating each other, these organizations have license to take of www.w3.org and keep serving the cache of lovely and valuable URLs found therein
20:56:17 <Biblio-> lol =P
20:56:49 <Biblio-> that's nice, but a lisghtly different problem, i think
20:56:51 <ericP> tx. i find that irreverence makes most conversations more fun
20:57:02 <Biblio-> most definitely =P
20:58:38 <ericP> you could use a p2p resolver to resolve HTTP URLs, and fall back to HTTP when you coulnd't get the complete (or desired portion of the) resource from p2p
20:58:50 <ericP> that would give you the best of both worlds
20:59:06 <Biblio-> couln't it be a central system as well?
21:00:09 <Biblio-> some central double entry table, with columns "document label" and "current url"?
21:00:09 <ericP> that is, you get to push the speed lever as close to the dangerous end (untrusted resource, failure to get the latest copy...) as was appropriate for the resource and for what you were doing with it
21:00:49 <ericP> why not have "the URL" => "some cached copy"?
21:01:10 <mlinksva> mlinksva has quit
21:02:06 <Biblio-> because most regular folk, unlike w3c, can not get someone to guarantee an eternal copy of their content somewhere?
21:02:59 <Biblio-> also...what i mean is that with the advvent of data stores, peole get to locally forget all about the physical layer. it's mentally different. so why not do the same globally?
21:05:19 <ericP> i appreciate the mental distinction, but i think that however you slice it (see the bio rdf URL issues), you end up with the same probs and that you may as well use directly-dereferenceable names
21:06:21 <ericP> as to eternal copies, these same probs arrise even with the extra level of indirection, but you also sacrifice the accountability of the organization that holds the domain name
21:06:33 <Biblio-> regarding conflict resolution, it implies to have unique document names. if i register 8by sending to some central place) a doc called "the wichita report", and later someone does the same...that person gets it rejected. wouldn't that do?
21:07:34 <ericP> ahh, that would require that some analog of the DNS system grow to cover all the documents
21:07:47 <Biblio-> yes
21:07:56 <ericP> as it is, it is a technical challenge to cover all the organizations that are creating documents
21:08:56 <ericP> it's essentially, a large hash table. without document hierarchy, i don't see how it will scale
21:09:37 <ericP> that said, i'm not opposed to a new scheme that allows us to use names, it's just that i haven't seen one get around the existing problems
21:10:33 <ericP> you could veiw google/altavista/... as the current mapping from description of the doc to the doc location
21:14:15 <Biblio-> true enough, yes
21:14:53 <Biblio-> but we still can not make links to the label, just to the url
21:15:44 <Biblio-> if the url changes, if the doc gets moved, we get a broken link, even if the doc still is online somwehere else

21:40:39 <Biblio-> ericp, given the mental impact for end-users...do you think the idea is worth implementing? in such case...who would one need to talk with?
21:42:00 <ericP> i think you need to work out the tech details, including minting collisions and resolution in the face of ephemoral organizations producing valuable documents
21:42:35 <Biblio-> true. i'm just a newbie, though...
21:46:01 <ericP> there is always a temptation to distract one's self and others by building a new stack
21:47:03 <ericP> it is, of course, admirable to attack these problems, but think it's best to focus on doing so with the existing technology
21:47:44 <ericP> for instance, <a href="The/Wichita/Report">
21:48:39 <ericP> for instance, <a href="http://example.com/titleRespository/en/The+Wichita+Report"> would solve your problem, and address some language issues at the same time
21:48:40 <Biblio-> but that will still be relative to the root dir within one server, if i understand correctly
21:49:40 <Biblio-> it would not be global, and will not allow you to move the doce to different servers, right?
21:49:49 <Biblio-> *doc

09:02:40 <bblfish> danja?
09:03:55 <bblfish> I don't quite understand what the thread of convergence is that you mention in: http://www.w3.org/mid/1f2ed5cd0607240122m72c6cce5j247608ec6dd38713@mail.gmail.com
09:10:04 <stain> I'm building a distributed filesystem, and I'm thinking about using rdf for all the metadata, such as directories, filenames, last-saved, etc.
09:10:19 <bblfish> sounds like an excellent idea
09:10:20 <stain> is there anything good existing stuff for distributed RDF ?
09:10:37 <stain> and is there an ontology for filesystem stuff? =)
09:11:17 <danja> bblfish, I didn't link to the BioRDF post I intended :-(
09:11:22 <danja> check http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-semweb-lifesci/2006Jul/0139.html
09:11:31 <bblfish> ah ok :-)
09:12:17 <bblfish> stain: I wrote a little blog about file systems and rdf http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bblfish?entry=limitation_of_iphoto
09:12:36 <karlUshi> karlUshi has joined #swig
09:12:53 <bblfish> stain: I wonder if atom:owl could help. If you think of it Atom is really just a way to add metadata to file system resources
09:13:23 <danja> stain, I vaguely remember other discussion re. fs & rdf, google may help (asking here a few times could be faster :-)
09:13:29 <stain> hm, I'm in life sciences, maybe the semweb-lifesci should be a good place
09:14:10 <bblfish> stail: atomOwl: http://bblfish.net/work/atom-owl/2006-06-06/
09:15:48 <bblfish> danja: yes, that link makes more sense regarding the vocab discussion
09:16:36 <stain> bblfish: hm, but there's not much of atom that is relevant
09:17:27 <danja> I have my doubts how far we could get replacing mime types with rdf, because the rdf usually comes further down the chain
09:18:05 <danja> but it does look like there's a lot of potential for modelling/providing hints
09:18:07 <stain> I really don't care much about the mime types either, because at a file system level there is no way you can know what mime type people are talking about
09:18:23 <stain> however, I do want to attach "cool" metadata such as which program generated the file
09:18:32 <stain> and if it's saved from a browser, where did it come from
09:18:51 <danja> stain, that could be really handy
09:18:55 <bblfish> I think there are conversations going on at crss purposes there btw
09:19:42 <danja> heh, as usual
09:20:59 <bblfish> stain: atom files and directories: http://groups.google.com/group/atom-owl/browse_thread/thread/cd856a4bcfd40316/
09:21:15 <stain> thanks
09:21:47 <bblfish> stain: just a thought to explore. But I don't know about distributed stuff. Definitely, sounds like a really good idea though
09:22:44 <bblfish> danja: yes. I am not sure what the best solution is either.
09:22:58 <bblfish> danja: kind of tricky
09:23:13 <danja> is it really such a problem?
09:23:45 <bblfish> I am not sure, not yet. But if we had a solution I could tear into a few arguments and cut them to smithereens
09:23:52 <danja> ok, we need some smarts for service description etc, like what a sparql endpoint knows about
09:24:06 <bblfish> also
09:24:08 <bblfish> yes
09:24:11 <stain> bblfish: I'm thinking about building transactions and use named graphs, that way each transaction can be serialized and distributed
09:24:17 <danja> but for non-rdf formats, there aren't really all that many
09:24:37 <danja> mime type
09:24:38 <danja> s
09:24:56 <bblfish> danja: the non rdf formats get by thinking they can heap everything onto the mime type
09:25:04 <bblfish> danja: which is crazy
09:25:27 <jeen> jeen has joined #swig
09:25:41 <bblfish> danja: but if you criticise them, they say that we have the same problem. We can't describe what type of vocab will appear in a doc.
09:25:42 <danja> dunno, it's only using a registry of names
09:26:30 <danja> but as someone pointed out, there are two levels at work - the syntax & semantics
09:27:35 <danja> with non-rdf formats mime types allow you to dispatch the doc to an appropriate tool to extract/use the semantics
09:27:57 <danja> with rdf you've got that up front
09:28:12 <stain> I don't find this xattr in my OS X
09:29:03 <giovannit> giovannit has joined #swig
09:29:30 <bblfish> stain: you need to read the article in ars technica in mail I referred to
09:30:01 <bblfish> danja: agree with syntax vs semantics distinction. This argument comes from a long thread in atom protocol here: http://www.imc.org/atom-protocol/mail-archive/msg05897.html
09:30:38 <Biblio-> today we discussed here if it was possible to use document names as links, instead of url's, for instance, to write <a href="The Wichita report">. is what you are discussing anything like it?
09:31:09 <bblfish> Biblio-: no, don't think so
09:31:20 <stain> bblfish: "See page 7"
09:31:24 <stain> hihi
09:31:25 <Biblio-> thanks, sorry
09:31:41 <stain> "More about this on the next page of the Internet"
09:32:55 <bblfish> stain: there is a download somewhere there for the xattr program
09:33:11 <bblfish> here I mean: http://arstechnica.com/reviews/os/macosx-10.4.ars/7
09:33:12 <stain> yes, found it
09:33:17 <bblfish> :-)
09:34:40 <bblfish> danja: you should send a mail out correcting your mistake :-/
09:37:03 <danja> done
09:37:13 <bblfish> danja: so I agree that we probably should not have this type of problem resolved at the http level. what we need is a way to describe the vocabulary that appears in a document. Then we can say that a class of docs is, say a foaf:Document, and so if we know that, and someone claims a doc is a foaf:Doc then we will know what is inside it
09:37:49 <danja> there is foaf:PersonalProfileDocument
09:37:56 <bblfish> exactly.
09:38:11 <bblfish> But there should be a way of specifying that precisely, and in a generalised way
09:38:44 <danja> <http://example.org/foaf> rdf:type foaf:PersonalProfileDocument ..?
09:38:56 <bblfish> that is the easy part
09:39:14 <bblfish> I mean one needs to be able to describe what a foaf:PersonalProfileDocument is precisely
09:39:19 <danja> generalised - I guess you could have plenty of other subClasses of foaf:Document
09:39:38 <danja> why?
09:40:07 <bblfish> well we just need a vocab to say things like: these types of triples appear in it, etc
09:40:24 <danja> for what purpose?
09:41:20 <danja> (I'm certainly not saying its a bad idea, but am not sure of the use cases)
09:41:24 <bblfish> SO that I don't have the problem I describe here: http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/semantic-web/2006Jul/0062.html
09:42:46 <bblfish> I think there are many situations when you need to be able to describe what type of information you would like to be sent
09:43:23 <danja> re. that problem, in the general case, for the full description you need all the data tthat's in it
09:43:47 <bblfish> ?
09:44:12 <danja> to be able to know the nature of all the triples in a doc, you need the doc
09:44:29 <bblfish> yes,..
09:44:57 <danja> but the conneg kind of idea could be handy
09:45:18 <danja> but does it need to be precise?
09:45:23 <bblfish> that would also be nice, true. More powerful
09:46:00 <bblfish> What we are looking for is a relax-ng type tyhing for rdf
09:46:35 <danja> rulesù
09:46:35 <danja> -ù
09:46:45 <danja> bah, thunderstorm, prolly have to dive out
09:46:53 <bblfish> ok :-)
09:46:57 <bblfish> thanks for the link

12:42:36 <iv_an_ru> Could you please provide me with contact details of the developer of Atomic as we have his editor working with Virtuoso, but there are some Atom spec clarifications that need to be discussed with him
12:42:56 <iv_an_ru> We have Atomic working with ODS Blog and Wiki Data Spaces apps.
12:43:37 <bblfish> Does virtuoso use AtomOwl?
12:44:09 <bblfish> AtomOwl: http://bblfish.net/work/atom-owl/2006-06-06/
12:44:27 <bblfish> We would like to have it be the default ontology for atom

13:02:38 <EliasT> iv_an_ru, could you post on pastebin.com an RDF representation of an atom entry?
13:02:49 <danja> * danja nods re. overload 
13:03:17 <bblfish> oh you mean in your database?
13:03:19 <EliasT> * EliasT is wondering how overload implies sw taking off.
13:03:31 <iv_an_ru> EliasT, I'll look for some developer of that application.
13:04:05 <bblfish> iv_an_ru: ah ok. Well the ontology has changed namespace over time
13:04:33 <EliasT> iv_an_ru, thanks.
13:05:56 <danja> EliasT, check the post rate at http://semtext.org/semblog/ (badly archived, m'fraid)
13:06:35 <danja> maybe one new bloggable semweb thing per week in 2003

13:12:34 <danja> bblfish, must have been when I moved from Blogger to Movable Type
13:12:53 <bblfish> google trends is not so helpful: http://www.google.com/trends?q=Semantic&ctab=0&geo=all&date=all
13:13:19 <bblfish> But then it is difficult: because as people bookmark things more, they tend to search less...
13:13:27 <danja> bblfish, and decided that a semweb-specific blog was too hard ;-)
13:13:50 <bblfish> :-)
13:14:26 <danja> trend seems to be *downwards*...
13:15:04 <bblfish> same with java though, as I say that does not mean it is not used a lot. As something gets to be very well know, people don't need to search so much for it
13:15:06 <danja> interest city list for "semantic web"

13:22:24 <EliasT> -> http://bblfish.net/work/atom-owl/2006-06-06/#'
13:23:09 <imitko_> The Virtuoso uses AtomOwl to fill the RDF tripple storage , but the Atom  feeds are not RDF format.
13:23:27 <EliasT> good news.
13:23:37 <EliasT> correct, the feeds are just Atom XML.
13:23:48 <EliasT> (as they should be)
13:24:09 <imitko_> also Virtuoso using SIOC ontology (http://rdfs.org/sioc/ )
13:24:40 <EliasT> We have a mailing list here: http://groups.google.com/group/atom-owl
13:25:04 <bblfish> imitko_: yes: it would be really nice to work out the overlaps between sioc and atomOwl too.

18:42:04 <iv_an_ru> bblfish, yes I'm here
18:42:35 <bblfish> oh hi
18:42:58 <bblfish> you are working on virtuoso right?
18:43:42 <iv_an_ru> yes, I'm writing the core (XML, XSLT, XQuery, now RDF), last 7 years :)
18:43:50 <bblfish> oh cool
18:44:10 <bblfish> virtuoso is also an object database right?
18:44:33 <bblfish> can one drop java objects in there?
18:44:50 <iv_an_ru> It's possible to store objects, but our customers prefer to user relational representations.
18:45:07 <fgiasson> fgiasson has joined #swig
18:45:35 <bblfish> ah ok. But it is considered an ODBMS, which means it does some special things for objects I suppose
18:45:46 <iv_an_ru> you can create persistent user-defined type with methods written on ahy hosted language. Java is in the list of supported.
18:46:27 <bblfish> I am working on https://sommer.dev.java.net/ a mapping using annotations from java to rdf. Sommer stands for Semantic Object (Metadata) Mapper
18:46:30 <iv_an_ru> We have canonical CREATE TYPE with BASED ON and optional SELF AS REF.
18:46:44 <bblfish> So this may be of interest to you.
18:47:20 <iv_an_ru> Checking now...
18:50:29 <bblfish> a good example of an annotated file is: https://sommer.dev.java.net/source/browse/sommer/trunk/test/src/eg/test/atom/AtomEntry.java?rev=41&view=markup
18:51:08 <bblfish> So I was thinking if these types of annotations were standardised, that could make it very easy for you to pop objects into your database...
18:54:16 <iv_an_ru> What does '@rdf(awol + "content")' mean? I guess awol is defined somewhere for a namespace, but the whole thing?
18:55:02 <bblfish> awol is a string (defined by import static eg.test.atom.Feed.awol)
18:55:10 <iv_an_ru> and @inverseFunctional btw ?
18:55:25 <bblfish> so its just equivalent to @rdf("https://.../#content")
18:55:39 <lkagal> lkagal has joined #swig
18:55:49 <bblfish>  @rdf(awol + "content") Content content;
18:55:53 <lkagal> lkagal has quit
18:56:10 <bblfish> means that content is a relation that maps to the url http://.../#content
18:56:25 <leobard> leobard has quit
18:56:28 <lkagal> lkagal has joined #swig
18:56:30 <bblfish> fields in the object are relations. @rdf(...) just helps us name them
18:56:54 <iv_an_ru> So this is for your preprocessor?
18:57:05 <bblfish> it works like EJB3.0
18:57:10 <bblfish> yes
18:57:26 <bblfish> I have a byte code rewriter that adds behavior to the objects given those mappings
18:58:02 <iv_an_ru> :) This explains why Java, not C++ :)
18:58:26 <bblfish> some examples of use: https://sommer.dev.java.net/source/browse/sommer/trunk/test/src/eg/test/MappedTest.java?rev=41&view=markup
18:58:55 <bblfish> I can map objects to a graph, or extract objects out of a graph
18:59:05 <iv_an_ru> I see.
18:59:06 <bblfish> because of those notations
18:59:44 <DanC> anybody around that has experience using SVN hooks? I wanna set up IRC notification of SVN commits
18:59:46 <phenny> DanC: 22 Jul 08:45Z <danja> tell DanC check http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2006-07-22#T08-32-20 re. GRDDL when it's scraped
19:00:26 <kpreid> DanC: I use http://cia.navi.cx/ for that
19:01:15 <timbl> timbl has joined #swig
19:01:32 <DanC> I'm not sure I want to go with a big-brother approach like that, kpreid, but let's say I did. What would be my first step? And about how long do you think it would take to get it working? I heard somewhere that it involves mail to a human that takes about a week to process.
19:01:45 <kpreid> DanC: true
19:02:03 <kpreid> but the first step is to install and configure the hook script, which is quite simple
19:02:17 <DanC> hmm... http://cia.navi.cx/doc/adding-projects suggests it doesn't involve mail thru a human
19:02:36 <kpreid> delivering commits to CIA doesn't
19:02:40 <bblfish> iv_an_ru: anyway you may find this interesting or helpful for your database. We have the father of JDO on the mailing list. Having someone with database experience just to listen in would be good. It's slow, cause I am all alone working on it at the moment, but hopefully others may find it useful too
19:02:49 <EliasT> DanC, I was discussing with timbl how we can add support for Tabulator to display atom feeds. However, most feeds won't have profile URLs. Do you have any thoughts?
19:02:51 <kpreid> configuring CIA to report them on a particular IRC channel does
19:03:18 <DanC> feeds aren't even XHTML, are they?
19:03:20 <kpreid> DanC: you get RSS and announcements on #commits automatically
19:03:42 <EliasT> feeds are XML.
19:03:47 <DanC> all feeds have the atom namespace name in them, yes?
19:03:51 <EliasT> yes
19:04:03 <DanC> we can stick a grddl txform there, once we get consensus in the IETF AtomPub WG
19:04:26 <EliasT> AtomPub/
19:04:26 <EliasT> ?
19:04:36 <DanC> .g atom namespace
19:04:39 <EliasT> There is Atom Syntax and Protocol.
19:04:39 <phenny> DanC: http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom
19:04:57 <DanC> "The namespace name http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom is intended for use as per The Atom Syndication Format, a December 2005 Proposed Standard developed by the IETF atompub Working Group"

19:05:18 <ronwalf> ronwalf has quit
19:05:27 <EliasT> k on atompub. So are you saying there's a way to attach a profile to the XML namespace so the documents don't need to include a link to the transform?
19:05:36 <evlist> evlist has quit
19:05:56 <DanC> yes.
19:06:21 <bblfish> DanC just wants me to write an XSLT 1.0 and not XSLT 2.0 methinks
19:06:29 <bblfish> :-)
19:06:33 <bblfish> But I don't have time
19:06:38 <chimezie> XSLT 1.0++
19:06:40 <EliasT> very cool. any pointer to that part of the spec.
19:06:51 <EliasT> bblfish, no excuses.. get going.
19:07:02 <DanC> see the p3q example, EliasT . http://www.w3.org/TeamSubmission/grddl/#ns-bind
19:07:12 <ottar> ottar has joined #swig
19:07:19 <ottar> ottar has left #swig
19:07:26 <DanC> well, the W3C XSLT service groks XSLT 2.0. I'm not sure if the GRDDL service has been upgraded, but that should be straightforward.
19:07:37 <DanC> but that's about the only GRDDL client I know of that groks XSLt 2.0
19:07:47 <DanC> does your XSLT 2.0 produce RDF/XML or turtle, bblfish ?
19:07:55 <bblfish> currently turtle
19:08:00 <bblfish> cause its nicer
19:08:02 <DanC> and when are you folks going to join the GRDDL WG? 1/2 ;-)
19:08:13 <bblfish> ah ok.
19:08:20 <bblfish> Man how many hours in a day are there?
19:08:27 <bblfish> .g hours
19:08:29 <phenny> bblfish: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0274558/
19:08:32 <EliasT> I've told bblfish a million times to focus on RDF/XML output and XSLT 1.0
19:08:40 <chimezie> * chimezie is thinking about it
19:08:41 <chimezie> so have I
19:08:46 <EliasT> .. but he keeps focusing on N3 and XQuery.
19:09:14 <bblfish> David Powell could easily adapt his script to produce XML/RDF in XSLT 1.0
19:09:20 <DanC> EliasT, that's the "no good deed goes unpunished" strategy. Sometimes it works, but it's better if we can say "thanks for doing your part, Henry; now let's find somebody else to carry the ball the next few yards"
19:10:03 <bblfish> He has a transform to atom/rdf. I did not want to rewrite his xslt
19:10:03 <bengee> bengee has quit
19:10:28 <EliasT> I'm just bustin' his chops.
19:10:34 <bblfish> ouch
19:10:53 <DanC> * DanC updates the status thingy on http://www.w3.org/2003/g/data-view ...
19:11:08 <EliasT> DanC, we were going to have one of my colleagues join GRDDL but he backed out.
19:11:38 <bblfish> Can one just look in?
19:11:50 <EliasT> I'm joining SWD for RDFa + DAWG, so I think I'm wg'd out.
19:12:11 <bblfish> I am on Atom (and that's the equivalent of 25 other WGs)
19:12:12 <iv_an_ru> bblfish, I'll ask who in our team is good in Java. I'm definitely not. But I've bookmarked the thing.
19:12:25 <bblfish> iv_an_ru: thanks :-)
19:12:48 <bblfish> EliasT: you need to woo D.P.
19:13:01 <bblfish> goto go
19:13:05 <bblfish> Dinner's ready
19:13:12 <EliasT> bbflish, for what?
19:13:14 <EliasT> for the XSLT?
19:13:18 <bblfish> yes
19:13:30 <bblfish> I asked on AtomOwl what licence it was under. But he did not say
19:13:37 <EliasT> k. I just don't know if he still wants to support his RDFS.
19:13:43 <DanC> * DanC wonders how he can convince EliasT that his time is better spend on GRDDL
19:14:34 <bblfish> EliasT: if he does not want to support RDFS, then it would be nice if he just adapted it for atom owl. There's a huge amount of good work in there
19:14:43 <LeeF> We'll leave it in your capable hands, DanC :-)
19:15:21 <EliasT> DanC, I guess I need to read the charter, but isn't most of it already defined or are you going into new territory.
19:15:22 <chimezie> That '1/2 a day per week commitement' in the charter does stand out
19:15:50 <timbl> * timbl is on Talk of the Nation
19:15:53 <DanC> 1/2 day is moderate/low; 1 day per week is the norm
19:16:42 <DanC> indeed, most of it is already defined. So we're just doing the last 80%, i.e. finishing the test suite and convincing people to deploy it.
19:17:09 <DanC> e.g. convincing the AtomPub WG to let us put a GRDDL txform in the atom namespace
19:17:48 <EliasT> One would think that the last part is easy since it doesn't affect them necessarily.
19:18:24 <EliasT> but like you mentioned today in the DIG meeting, don't we need AtomOWL to be 'official' (by all extents of the word) in order to intercept the Atom NS.
19:18:24 <DanC> but it does affect them. They have to endorse it, maybe answer questions about it, etc.
19:18:39 <EliasT> That'll be very hard.
19:18:48 <DanC> yes, official means convincing the AtomPub WG.
19:19:12 <DanC> if the AtomPub WG doesn't endorse it, then by extension, atom authors can't be held accountable for it.
19:19:21 <chimezie> cross technology camp concensus is never easy esp. considering these camps
19:19:34 <EliasT> chimezie, especially these 2 camps.
19:19:51 <EliasT> ... and Henry is finding it out all the hard way.
19:20:06 <chimezie> yeah, kudos for him for subjecting himself to that onslaught
19:20:10 <chimezie> bblfish++
19:20:14 <chimezie> taking one for the team :)
19:20:19 <EliasT> thinking whether kudos is the right word.
19:20:49 <EliasT> I don't know if he's helping the team or not at the end of the day.
19:20:51 <DanC> * DanC remains convinced that Atom/OWL isn't the shortest path to victory; that RSS/RDF (aka 1.0) is still the best bet.
19:21:14 <EliasT> DanC, can you elaborate on that/
19:21:56 <EliasT> instead of coming up with our own vocabulary just use all the existing: rdf, rdfs, dc, foaf, etc?
19:22:37 <DanC> Atom solves a few interoperability issues in the core of RSS (e.g. double-escaped HTML markup) but it doesn't really solve the extensibility issues. Google/Apple/etc. are still proposing 3 new RSS 2 extensions a week, and fumbling over each other.
19:22:54 <EliasT>  agreed.
19:23:02 <DanC> RDF is not free, but once you pay the RDF tax, you really do get extensibility and mix/match for frree.
19:23:19 <ndw> * ndw wonders if DanC has a moment for a couple of Python questions from dangerSync
19:23:34 <EliasT> I'm currently running the scenario in my head to extend Atom content by using RDFa inside XHTML
19:23:37 <chimezie> funny, I consider XML->RDF mappings more of an investment than a 'tax'
19:23:42 <EliasT> ... in either atom:summary or atom:content
19:23:48 <ndw> In particular, I can't see why "del shelf[`id`]" instead of simply "del shelf[id]"
19:23:55 <DanC> * DanC is embarrassed at the current state of dangerSync code; supposes answering questions is suitable penance
19:24:17 <ndw> Even more mysterious: k = `record['id']`
19:24:18 <DanC> yes, investment is better than tax
19:24:22 <EliasT> chimezie, that's the difference between the two groups: tax vs investment
19:24:24 <ndw> Why the backticks?
19:24:49 <DanC> one use of backticks is to convert from numbers to strings. lemme check...
19:25:08 <ndw> Ah so shelf[`id`] instead of shelf[str(id)]
19:25:10 <ndw> Ok.
19:25:22 <DanC> yes, shelve requires string keys, I think
19:25:29 <ndw> and the second case?
19:25:38 <ndw> Yes, shelves require strings, I got barked at for that
19:25:44 <ndw> (at one point)
19:26:32 <DanC> k = `record['id']` gets the 'id' field out of the record, converts to string, and puts it in k
19:26:41 <DanC> `` is actually repr(), not str().
19:26:51 <DanC> but for integers, I think there's no difference
19:26:56 <ndw> Ah
19:27:17 <ndw> I wasn't getting the precedence right mentally
19:27:21 <ndw> thx
19:27:22 <EliasT> DanC, the major deterrant for me joining anything at the W3C is the amount of paperwork and meetings you have to go through at IBM to join a new working group. For SWD, Welty is doing the paperwork so I can ride for free. For GRDDL, there's no one else in the company, so I'd have to do all of the work. :(
19:27:23 <DanC> sure
19:28:16 <DanC> paperwork... sigh...
19:28:26 <DanC> * DanC curses the patent system
19:29:27 <DanC> that's why stuff like microformats.org can go faster than W3C. They just go "patents? what patents? whee!"
19:30:00 <EliasT> right, but also microformats.org doens't pay salaries.
19:30:12 <chimezie> You can't get true industry-wide concensus w/out wrangling w/ patents tho
19:30:13 <DanC> yes, that too
19:30:54 <EliasT> and as chimezie puts it, IBM can't use microformats.org as a reference/organization.
19:31:17 <DanC> but you're free to hack on hCalendar/hCard foo
19:31:52 <EliasT> sure, anyone is.
19:32:12 <DanC> well, time was when nobody at IBM was allowed to look at any code not written in IBM, or something close to that.
19:32:49 <EliasT> back on Atom, if we don't have profile and/or Atom NS grddl hooks, we are on our own? sniffing content?
19:33:08 <EliasT> also you prolly missed this comment: EliasT: I'm currently running the scenario in my head to extend Atom content by using RDFa inside XHTML
19:33:11 <DanC> you can use the grddl:transformation attribute
19:33:41 <EliasT> right, but most feeds won't do such a thing and timbl wants to display feed contents in tabulator.
19:34:31 <DanC> well, the tabulator already does all kinds of sniffing for calendars and maps. might as well sniff for feeds too, I guess. (blech.)
19:34:41 <EliasT> blech it is.
19:34:52 <iand> in theory one should be able to get a grddl xform from the media type somehow
19:34:56 <EliasT> we need out-of-band profiles...
19:35:05 <EliasT> exactly, iand.
19:35:43 <iand> there are a number of out of band places and probably a hierarchy of authority: media type, namespace URI, grddl http header
19:35:43 <DanC> media type? why is that better than the namespace, in the Atom case, iand ?
19:35:53 <DanC> in either case, it has to be endorsed by the folks that own Atom
19:35:54 <iand> not better, just different
19:36:42 <DanC> out-of-band profiles is the same thing as scraping
19:36:53 <DanC> either the author agreed or he didn't. it's pretty simple.
19:37:44 <DanC> those are all in-band, no? (http header, media type, namespace)
19:37:46 <iand> * iand was about to point to http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/mime-respect but...
19:37:53 <iand> Error loading stylesheet: An XSLT stylesheet does not have an XML mimetype:http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/versioning.xsl
19:38:17 <iand> some irony there
19:38:40 <DanC> this works for me: http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/versioning
19:38:49 <iand> me too
19:39:00 <iand> this works for me: http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/mime-respect.html
19:41:57 <iand> do those principles apply only to mime, or to all metadata?
19:42:32 <DanC> all, I think. I'd have to study the details to be sure, though.

20:34:03 <danja> hmm, DanC: remains convinced that Atom/OWL isn't the shortest path to victory; that RSS/RDF (aka 1.0) is still the best bet
20:34:32 <danja> "Google/Apple/etc. are still proposing 3 new RSS 2 extensions a week, and fumbling over each other."
20:34:53 <danja> true, but how likely are they to 1. drop RSS 2 in favour of RSS 1.0
20:35:08 <danja> 2. drop RSS 2 in favour of Atom
20:37:31 <perigrin> 3. give up on both and band together to "solve" the problem
20:37:35 <danja> (or not even necessarily drop RSS 2, just adopt Atom as well)
20:37:36 <DanC> not likely. I tried, a little bit, to convince some relevant folks, without much progress
20:39:19 <danja> The yahoo media RSS thing was interesting politically
20:39:40 <danja> they were keen on 'community' input
20:39:55 <WikierOFF> WikierOFF is now known as Wikier
20:40:10 <danja> but from the start it was apparent that the primary serial would be RSS 2
20:40:45 <danja> the (implied) model behind the syntax they came up with wasn't bad at all
20:41:14 <danja> then it gets swilled with RSS 2
20:42:56 <DanC> I don't know where the "media RSS" stuff will end up. I think hAtom is pretty interesting; I watch that from a distance.
20:43:11 <danja> heh, yeag I like that one

21:53:58 <iv_an_ru> Briefly speaking, you can couple sommer with Virtuoso in many ways.
21:53:58 <iv_an_ru> Case 1. An application that uses sommer and gets RDF data from external sources, including SPARQL web service endpoints that support CONSTRUCT, including Virtuoso.
21:53:58 <iv_an_ru> Case 2. An application that uses sommer in Virtuoso and easily import remote RDF data into instances of user-defined data types.
21:53:58 <iv_an_ru> Case 3. An application that uses slightly patched sommer is hosted in Virtuoso and access local RDF data extremely quickly, by asking SPARQL queries via 'in-process client'.

01:09:45 <kpreid> jargonjustin_: yes
01:09:56 <jargonjustin_> Eww, okay.
01:10:39 <kpreid> the namespace/local-name split in RDF/XML is purely syntactic and makes no difference to the meaning (the triples it stands for)
01:11:38 <jargonjustin_> kpreid: It makes sense, but it runs somewhat counter to XML vocabularies.
01:12:02 <kpreid> yup
01:12:09 <kpreid> RDF/XML is strange XML
01:12:41 <jargonjustin_> It doesn't really seem like XML... more like RDF with angle brackets :-/
01:13:00 <jargonjustin_> Has there been any work in other XML serialization formats?
01:13:48 <kpreid> I don't know.
01:14:05 <jargonjustin_> Okay, thanks.
01:14:08 <kpreid> There is the N3, N-Triples, Turtle family, of course.
01:16:27 <jargonjustin_> kpreid: I was looking for a better way of embedding RDF into other XML documents without using RDFa (not always XHTML) or GRDDL.
01:24:18 <perigrin> perigrin has joined #swig
01:40:11 <ericP> jargonjustin_, that a lot of "withouts". what are your constraints?
01:42:16 <ericP> re namespace/local-name split, the infoset keeps the namespace and local-name separate. XML apps are free to do what they want with them
01:42:41 <ericP> in that regard, RDF/XML is an atypically simple XML app
01:44:00 <ericP> the reason for that is that RDF simply uses URIs instead of these tuples that the infoset makes available
01:44:44 <ericP> it could just as well have used a different mapping to URI, one that involved separating the two with a character that was not allowed in local-name
01:45:44 <ericP> but that would have been a bit more complication and i doubt that it would have served much purpose (other than allowing one to find the orig namespaces)

01:58:43 <DanC> * DanC is making his 1st solder joint in years...
01:59:54 <bblfish> I was looking at RSS1.1 recently, and I think one difference that stands out, is that an Entry deals perhaps better with changes to a resource
02:01:05 <bblfish> as I understand in RSS1.1 the Item is a url: the thing one is speaking about. In atom it is a blank node (controversially a cifp on id and updated)
02:02:55 <bblfish> but I have very little exposure to RSS1.1, so I may very well be missing a lot there...

07:57:59 <Biblio> newbie question of the day: why did TBL make tabulator? why no heystack? how are they different?
07:59:02 <libby> I'd guess it was because it's much ore lightweight
07:59:05 <libby> more
07:59:38 <Biblio> libby only reason i could think as well. but isn't haystack way better?
08:00:20 <Biblio> it has map view and timeline view as well, i think
08:02:23 <Biblio> (i see in tabulator they thought about chart view as well, though, which was tho other logical view to add
08:03:25 <Biblio> thanks, libby. i really do not understand.
08:03:37 <bengee> Biblio, it's quite common that developers roll their own tools even when there may be software that already does the job in a more elegant way
08:03:49 <bengee> there is not much to (not) understand really
08:03:53 <AndyS> AndyS has joined #swig
08:03:56 <Biblio> bengee, i see.
08:08:05 <Biblio> i have sustained in some places that W3C should make soft (open source, free, platform-independent) as well, not just specs. at least, libraries. preferably full working apps.
08:09:00 <Biblio> but then...it is corporations who pay the bills. there might be a conflict of interests, at the very base of the model
08:09:19 <ldodds> ldodds has joined #swig
08:09:45 <AndyS> Not in all cases
08:10:40 <Biblio> i'd really like to see a W3C web 1.0 browser, for instance.
08:10:52 <Biblio> then a second, semweb enabled one
08:12:08 <AndyS> The sort of people who do specs aren't necessarily the sort of people to go code.
08:13:13 <Biblio> andys, well...but who is then accountable for not having decent apps?
08:13:34 <iand> iand has joined #swig
08:13:35 <Biblio> standard bodies point you to vendors. and vendors do not care...
08:15:06 <AndyS> "Accountable"?  Strange concept, esp for the semantic web which is bottom up federation.
08:15:26 <mlinksva> mlinksva has joined #swig
08:15:46 <AndyS> If there are no decent apps it's because there isn't the right supply/demand environment.
08:15:59 <AndyS> Or the "right" apps haven't been found yet.
08:17:33 <Biblio> millions of grandmothers, andys. plumbers, etc. worldwide. years and years. lots of frustration.
08:22:03 <AndyS> So why hasn't it been written?  Lots of people trying - lots of poss conclusions
08:22:21 <AndyS> e.g. there isn't "one app" - it's all long tail.
08:22:58 <AndyS> So "millions of" might be the the wrong model, there isn't the uniformity of many users wanting the same thing.

09:08:44 <Biblio> bengee, i'm reading bnode, and it says: RDFa:
09:08:44 <Biblio>     * (+) follows certain microformats principles (e.g. "Don't repeat yourself")
09:09:01 <Biblio> could you please explain me a little what it means?
09:10:21 <libby> libby has quit
09:10:28 <Biblio> (the context is embedding RDF into hypertext)
09:11:52 <ndw> ndw has joined #swig
09:12:27 <boneill> boneill has joined #swig
09:12:44 <bengee> it means that visible content can directly be used by machines as well, i.e. you don't have to provide information twice (one version for humans, and a separate one for software)
09:13:22 <bengee> iow: a single source for multiple purposes
09:14:10 <Biblio> bengee, thanks
09:14:15 <bengee> np
09:16:57 <Biblio> beenge, if you implemented something like this: http://www.teoriadetodo.com.ar/fips/specs/cdl/anatomy.htm , would you need to repeat?
09:18:27 <bengee> not sure I understand your question
09:18:27 <libby> libby has joined #swig
09:19:48 <Biblio> that page basically describes something like xhtml, but in which content, presentation, structure, meaning and behaviour are all separated
09:20:33 <bengee> oh, you're going to build a one-person w3c?
09:20:54 <Biblio> and all but content can be defined externally, and linked, much like css is today
09:21:12 <Biblio> bengee, lol, i can not even program a variable assignment in php =P
09:21:19 <bengee> there is another principle: don't re-invent the wheel
09:21:37 <Biblio> some other call that "patching#, bengee
09:21:54 <bengee> patching from scratch, it seems
09:22:01 <Biblio> it makes sense sometimes, but perhaps not so other times
09:22:38 <bengee> a wheel that would need new cars, bikes, garages, ...
09:23:11 <Biblio> i understand what you mean, yes.
09:25:39 <bengee> if you are looking for ambitous, unpromising projects to waste all your energy with, try RDF ;)
09:26:22 <Biblio> not your cup of tea, i assume?
09:26:32 <bengee> *ambitious* even
09:26:51 <Biblio> if not RDF..then what?
09:26:55 <bengee> when it comes to tea, better ask libby ;)

09:29:23 <bengee> heh
09:29:28 <Biblio> =P
09:31:32 <libby> alright, I spose I like rdf too
09:31:35 <libby> a bit
09:34:21 <Biblio> if we define a datastructure (say a bunch of fields in some schema language) and hang it in some url. if we also define some relationships between the datastructure fields and some other ones in some other url...that would pretty much cover what rdf does, right? defining resources and relationships?
09:35:22 <Biblio> we could then just embed those fields in xhtml, as long as put a pointer to those files we prepared before, i think?
09:37:11 <Biblio> wouldn't we gain in clarity and reusability?

11:57:39 <CaptSolo> any SPARLQ gurus around?
11:57:53 <ericP> um, some SPARQL editors
11:57:59 <CaptSolo> hi eric :)
11:58:02 <ericP> heya
11:58:07 <CaptSolo> how's life?
11:58:16 <ericP> sleepy
11:58:20 <ericP> yours?
11:58:24 <CaptSolo> man, it's daytime
11:58:30 <CaptSolo> how can you be sleepy? :)
11:58:41 <CaptSolo> i'm fine, sleepy as well as a matter of fact
11:58:49 <CaptSolo> * CaptSolo is always sleepy before 5pm
11:59:09 <CaptSolo> ok, back to business
11:59:25 <ericP> and i'm rendered sleepy by wresting with SPARQL's semantics
11:59:28 <ericP> go ahead
11:59:30 <CaptSolo> i have a list of URIs
12:00:14 <CaptSolo> i want to find all resources whose property value is one of the URIs from the list
12:00:33 <CaptSolo> e.g., ?forum sioc:container_of ?posts .
12:00:51 <CaptSolo> the problem is that there are many posts, so such simple syntax won't work
12:00:53 <CaptSolo> -
12:01:13 <ericP> and ?posts should match something in a list
12:01:18 <CaptSolo> i can either just iterate through a list of URIs and ask a query for each of them
12:01:27 <ericP> this list is known at query time? or is it also derived from the list?
12:01:29 <CaptSolo> or construct something smarter
12:01:42 <CaptSolo> the list is known at query time
12:01:54 <CaptSolo> list is a python object
12:02:06 <ericP> FILTER (?posts = <URI1> || ?posts = <URI2> || ?posts = <URI3>)
12:02:21 <CaptSolo> right, that was my best gues
12:02:22 <CaptSolo> guess
12:02:33 <bengee> bengee has quit
12:02:35 <CaptSolo> ok, that should work
12:02:45 <AndyS> Can also use OPTIONAL and !bound in devious ways.
12:02:56 <ericP> or you could write an extension function akin to SQL's IN
12:02:57 <AndyS> It can do dynamic EXISTS
12:03:24 <CaptSolo> AndyS: OPTIONAL + !bound works if you need a NOT
12:03:25 <danja> danja has quit
12:03:29 <bengee> bengee has joined #swig
12:03:40 <AndyS> Take the cross product (?x, ?y) of the thing and the list of things it can be - look for ?x = ?y
12:03:56 <CaptSolo> ericP: writing crazy extension functions is a beyond my current capabilities
12:03:58 <CaptSolo> neet to level up
12:04:45 <ericP> * ericP was hacking an extra crazy extension function that did SPARQL queries
12:04:51 <AndyS> That works for +ve as well.  I did one recently for a Q on jena-dev. Look for the existance of a graph pattern but teh way is the same.  Efficiency? Huh?
12:05:23 <CaptSolo> AndyS: 'dynamic EXISTS'? how's that? can you give an example?
12:05:25 <AndyS> EricP - not a legal function - can't (= shouldn't :) assign to variables!
12:05:52 <CaptSolo> ericP: what was that extra crazy extension doing?
12:06:17 <CaptSolo> if i wrote an extension then that would be specific to a particular SPARQL engine that i hacked, right?
12:06:19 <AndyS> See above.  Form the solutions (?thing, ?maybeRight) and look for ?thing = ?maybeRight - can get ?maybeRight from a pattern elsewhere in the query.
12:06:20 <CaptSolo> that's not nice
12:07:07 <CaptSolo> * CaptSolo has little knowledge of SPARQL yet
12:07:42 <ericP> yeah, this was definitely in the hare-brained scheme category
12:08:16 <ericP> didn't assign vars, though (well, did, but to a temorary result set)
12:09:39 <AndyS> The thread ended at http://groups.yahoo.com/group/jena-dev/message/24042
12:09:46 <CaptSolo> AndyS: is what you described the same thing that EricP suggested with FILTER ?
12:09:56 <CaptSolo> or is it a different way of writing it?
12:10:17 <CaptSolo> as i understand this is exactly what happens with FILTER (?posts = <URI1> || ?posts = <URI2> || ?posts = <URI3>)
12:10:27 <AndyS> No.  EricP is suggesting adding a function that does the test you want as FILTER (my:Function(...))
12:10:40 <CaptSolo> no, not initially
12:10:41 <AndyS> You get to write my:Function
12:10:45 <CaptSolo> 15:05 < ericP> FILTER (?posts = <URI1> || ?posts = <URI2> || ?posts = <URI3>)
12:11:14 <CaptSolo> was the first thing ericP mentioned
12:11:21 <AndyS> That solution by Eric does the case where you know <URI1> ... at query build time.  It's the easiest approach.
12:11:27 <CaptSolo> but i guess writing custom functions was what caught your attention :)
12:11:52 <CaptSolo> i do know URIs at query build time
12:12:26 <AndyS> No - silly ways to use OPTIONAL/bound caught my attention.  You can do max() in SPARQL that way.
12:12:31 <libby> libby has quit
12:12:37 <CaptSolo> wow :)
12:12:40 <AndyS> The "trick" works for a whole class of problems.
12:12:44 <CaptSolo> can you do COUNT ?
12:12:58 <CaptSolo> it'd be good to have a wiki page with all these 'tricks' described
12:13:16 <AndyS> Form the cross product and look for the answer in an optional.  Then test to see if found.  (With max() there is always an answer.)
12:14:12 <AndyS> No!  People might start using them!  And asking question about them!!!  They are horrible - make APL look easy to read.
12:14:20 <libby> libby has joined #swig
12:14:33 <CaptSolo> hehe ;)
12:14:51 <AndyS> Msg 24042 uses the negation hack and the cross product hack.
12:14:53 <CaptSolo> soon there will form a Cult of SPARQL Tricks
12:15:16 <CaptSolo> and you now want to limit this knowledge to the chosen few....
12:16:01 <AndyS> Of course.  Need to ensure my employment.  And the initiation ceremony is fun (for some of the people involved)
12:16:39 <AndyS> I never did understand the upside down bit that Eric insisted on including in the ceremony.

12:19:13 <kpreid> kpreid has joined #swig
12:20:28 <CaptSolo> the upside down bit?
12:20:45 <CaptSolo> ericP: what weird ideas are in your mind?
12:21:25 <AndyS> Eric is much more devious about queries than I am.
12:22:23 <ericP> i acutally don't think SQL:IN is a very useful function. it's more of a macro
12:22:23 <CaptSolo> is he
12:22:29 <ericP> am i?
12:22:50 <ericP> gosh, now i feel the need to live up to that
12:22:54 <CaptSolo> he was the one who suggested the straightforward FILTER approach, was he not?
12:23:11 <CaptSolo> ericP: yes, common!
12:23:59 <CaptSolo> show some deviousness
12:24:26 <rudi> rudi has left #swig
12:24:57 <CaptSolo> ericP: what does SQL:IN stand for? a disjunction of (..=value1) OR (..=value2) ... ?
12:25:34 <ericP> yup
12:33:22 <CaptSolo> so... awaiting some devious SPARQLets from you now :)
12:33:30 <CaptSolo> ericP: Liga says hello :)
12:33:56 <ericP> hello to Liga
12:34:34 <CaptSolo> ericP, AndyS: thanks a lot. the FILTER solution is straightforward, but it is alway interesting to learn new 'tricks' that can be done with SPARQL (or anything else)
12:38:46 <ericP> if you wanted to save bytes, you might be able to come up with a fabulously complex regexp that matches exactly those URIs

19:28:44 <dc_swig> Replaced comment D2.
19:30:27 <perigrin> there was a nifty AIML + Cyc system (CyN I think) that I wanted to try out.
19:30:33 <dmiles_afk> figure people in here be interested becasue the work was inspired and integrating into the RDF system for Wikipeda
19:31:06 <dmiles_afk> right this system is called CyN-D .. i combined his CyN system into the game
19:31:33 <dmiles_afk> since it made it real easy to write AIMl script into imparative commands
19:31:40 <dmiles_afk> especially at a debugging stage
19:31:46 <perigrin> ooh nifty
19:32:16 <dmiles_afk> so like "can you see player1?" turns into (#$sees #$cyc_bot_1 #$player1)
19:33:20 <dmiles_afk> but then when i sy "approach it" it can execute the (script "walkTo" #$cyc_bot_1 #$player1)
19:34:04 <dmiles_afk> the (#$sees #$cyc_bot_1 #$player1) however i translate into a Cyc call that hooks into the doom engine
19:34:21 <dmiles_afk> but thats done inside the general infernece mechansim
19:36:07 <dmiles_afk> part of that video shows work that the author of CycN (Kino) and I are doing to get Wikipedia articals marked up with CycL so that this is further avaiable to Semantic web
19:36:45 <dmiles_afk> so all a person would do is use the RDF versions of Cyc to be able to get it
19:37:17 <dmiles_afk> however no ones probly come up with a end-all solution to marking up "free text"
19:38:33 <kingsleyidehen> kingsleyidehen has joined #swig
19:40:42 <perigrin> I really need to get free time to explore Cyc, CyN and the RDF stuff. I know Richard Wallace was interested at one point about the intersection of RSS and AIML, and I've been fascinated with AIML as RDF for a while now.
19:41:44 <dmiles_afk> its pretty easy to add in Tags to an aiml interpreter.. like we added <cycquery> but just as easily and add (sparql>
19:41:49 <dmiles_afk> <sparql>
19:43:37 <dmiles_afk> i am trying to get the system to when someone has free time.. to be able to run it and experments from the AIML context much easier.. right now it will take a licience from cycorp to get a good image of research cyc.. its free  though.. its just an NDA you'd sign
19:45:37 <dmiles_afk> but the current CyN system is a good start/intro into the rabbit hole
19:45:49 <perigrin> I'm limited in the only language I'm comfortable in is perl ... and teh AIML interpreter in perl is ... non-existant.
19:45:58 <perigrin> (or rather as good as)
19:46:38 <dmiles_afk> well funny becasue AIML is all regexpr
19:46:45 <dmiles_afk> but so is RDF
19:46:53 <perigrin> Yeah :)
19:47:25 <perigrin> Looking at it, it should be fairly trivial to build an AIML interpreter using libxml, but ENOTIME.
19:47:54 <peace-kee> lol ENOTIME :D
19:49:04 <dmiles_afk> well AIML in gernaly can be taken alot further.. then its getting everones langauge implemtnations up to speed with new capabilies
19:49:25 <perigrin> or getting one true libaiml that everyone embedds :)
19:49:50 <dmiles_afk> i chopse the java version "bitoflife".. becasue i have a huge repository of java packages that instantly usable w/o much hacking
19:50:02 <perigrin> * perigrin nods.

19:51:30 <dmiles_afk> the java engine using the c extensions was able to interface inline t a running quake4 .. the whole interest in "games" is that the "rules" are used to forward chain and create the world the player plays in
19:51:59 <dmiles_afk> give AIML some concrete domain to talk about.. SHURDLU

01:25:32 <jargonjustin_> In RDF/XML, are rdf:about and rdf:ID semantically equivalent?
01:26:05 <EliasT> jargonjustin_, rdf:about are for resources, rdf:ID is for blank nodes.
01:26:36 <jargonjustin_> EliasT: So rdf:ID can't be used to reference the resource outside of the document?
01:26:44 <EliasT> jargonjustin_: correct
01:26:52 <eatmypiano> eatmypiano has joined #swig
01:28:03 <jargonjustin_> So rdf:ID="foo" would be referencing _:foo where as rdf:about="foo" would reference whatever the xml:base is, concatenated with "foo"?
01:28:24 <EliasT> jargonjustin_: correct
01:28:27 <sheets> EliasT, you mean rdf:nodeID?
01:28:44 <EliasT> sheets, hmm.
01:28:45 <sheets> rdf:ID="foo" is like rdf:about="#foo" no?

01:31:41 <sheets> * sheets commiserates
01:32:12 <sheets> It's fresh in my mind because I just finished writing a parser
01:32:35 <EliasT> in JavaScript?
01:32:36 <jargonjustin_> I'm still working my way through some of the specs, but it doesn't seem _that_ bad... just not as nice as Turtle, et al.  The only thing I really dislike is having to use entities to shortcut URIs for some things (datatypes, etc)
01:32:39 <sheets> EliasT, yes
01:32:46 <EliasT> sweet!
01:33:07 <EliasT> jargonjustin_: listen to sheets, he's your guy (he is right?)
01:33:13 <sheets> yep
01:33:25 <jargonjustin_> Is there any available literature on criticism of RDF/XML specifically?
01:33:26 <EliasT> sheets, were you at the dig meeting on Mon?
01:33:36 <EliasT> jargonjustin_: search for rdf/xml on google. :-)
01:33:56 <sheets> EliasT, indeed. I was sitting in the back and I think the only thing I said all meeting was related to liking to meet your mother if she ran apache
01:34:13 <sheets> Some of the keywords for the RDF/XML spec are... poorly chosen
01:34:19 <sheets> Other than that, I think it's really well done
01:34:39 <jargonjustin_> sheets: Which ones in particular?
01:34:58 <sheets> jargonjustin_, ID vs. nodeID is unnecessarily confusing for one
01:35:20 <jargonjustin_> sheets: Yeah... finding that out the hard way :-)
01:35:28 <sheets> rdf:parsetype="Resource" could be better because "Resource" is just about as good as "Data"
01:35:41 <sheets> and used to mean very different things
01:35:55 <sheets> one could argue that rdfs:Resource is poorly chosen
01:36:19 <sheets> I was just talking to timbl today about this: it was a big sticking point for me when understanding rdfs
01:36:21 <EliasT> rdf:parsetype=Literal"
01:36:26 <sheets> ohhhh yes
01:36:30 <sheets> That's horrible
01:36:42 <sheets> It means XMLLiteral but it's just called Literal
01:36:54 <jargonjustin_> sheets: XML would make it far more readable.
01:37:07 <jargonjustin_> rdf:parsetype="XML" that is...
01:37:29 <sheets> jargonjustin_, hmm... that's also kind of ambiguous, though, because the whole thing is XML
01:37:41 <EliasT> sheets: keep me posted when you release the parser.

01:43:59 <Biblio> sheets, i asked here yerterday...what was the purpose for writing tabulator? i mean haystack exists, for instance. what is the difference?
01:44:16 <EliasT> haystack runs in Eclipse/Java, tabulator runs in the browser.
01:44:20 <sheets> yes
01:44:33 <sheets> Also, I don't know if haystack pulls down data as it browses/queries
01:44:43 <EliasT> * EliasT thinks it did.
01:44:47 <Biblio> meaning the ajax side of things?
01:44:48 <sheets> You'd have to ask timbl to get the full answer
01:44:52 <sheets> yes
01:44:56 <DanC> * DanC tunes in, scrolls back...
01:45:11 <Biblio> thanks, sheets, eliast
01:45:26 <sheets> or DanC
01:45:56 <Biblio> hello, danc =P
01:46:18 <DanC> "rdf:ID is for blank nodes." huh?
01:46:41 <EliasT> * EliasT excuses himself. sheets corrected me.
01:46:44 <DanC> * DanC sees that was fixed
01:49:37 <DanC> tabulator and haystack ... it's never occurred to me that they're similar at all. I guess they are, in some ways.
01:49:44 <EliasT> wow.
01:50:12 <EliasT> I saw tabulator and said: browser.
01:50:34 <DanC> sorry, I have a fear of java that's only partly rational. I don't think I've ever gotten haystack working
01:51:14 <Biblio> mm, but java or not java, is just a matter of implementation, i mean. what i tend to perceive are concepts
01:51:16 <EliasT> I developed on it with Dennis Quan a few years back. I'm not sure if it still runs.
01:52:05 <DanC> I almost found time to get eclipse running last month.
01:52:06 <EliasT> * EliasT *tried* to develop on it for our CVIT.org / Life Sciences work at IBM.
01:53:11 <DanC> hmm... have you tried mixing tabulator and queso, EliasT ?
01:53:23 <EliasT> that's the plan. that's why I need GRDDL for Atom
01:53:27 <Biblio> i didn't get to run haystack, myself either. but just watching the screenshots, was at least enough to get the general idea of what a "semantic browser" might turn out to be

11:04:21 <bblfish> I think I asked before how to get cwm to produce turtle output, and was told to use --data, but I don't think that's enough. Turtle does not allow the ^ notation nor the = notation.
11:06:46 <sbp> bblfish: --ntriples    Input & Output in NTriples (equiv --n3=uspartane -bySubject -quiet)
11:06:51 <sbp> - http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/doc/CwmHelp
11:07:48 <bblfish> euh. yes that is turtle :-) but it's a little too sparse...
11:07:57 <bblfish> that generates ntriples
11:08:44 <bblfish> I mean it generates turtle in the same way it generates N3
11:08:56 <bblfish> because ntriples is a subset of both
11:10:56 <sbp> oh, you still want it to be readable? :-)
11:11:38 <bblfish> yes. I was hoping there would be a little flag there to downgrade
11:11:56 <sbp> in the past I've written filters for this sort of thing, for example when the N-Triples output didn't align with N-Triples...
11:12:23 <sbp> but until the N3 syntax is basically stable, I wouldn't be so comfortable about doing that with something like this
11:12:44 <sbp> on the other hand, scanning for paths and = should only require a tokeniser
11:12:57 <sbp> which removes one layer of woes
11:13:15 <bblfish> oh yes.... I was hoping not to have to do any work...
11:13:28 <libby> libby has quit
11:17:53 <sbp> not usually possible, with CWM :-)
11:19:38 <bblfish> sbp: I mentioned your ideas concerning discovering graph patterns on the semantic web mailing list
11:23:03 <libby> libby has joined #swig
11:23:25 <bblfish> ok: well I can transform to ntriples using cwm and then to turtle using rapper
11:23:33 <timbl> timbl has joined #swig
11:24:39 <bblfish> oh no, I can't. rapper does not output turtle
11:27:19 <timbl> timbl has quit
11:33:26 <sbp> * sbp looks at semantic-web
11:34:41 <bblfish> here: http://www.w3.org/mid/78C52B89-E8E2-4117-A05E-8206CD357FB1@bblfish.net
11:35:21 <bblfish> and then a new thread here: http://www.w3.org/mid/1f2ed5cd0607240122m72c6cce5j247608ec6dd38713@mail.gmail.com
11:36:21 <sbp> not sure about the reification point
11:37:04 <bblfish> Laura Lane loves Superman
11:37:12 <bblfish> Supermans is Klark Kent
11:37:24 <bblfish> so Laura Lane loves Clark Kent
11:37:34 <bblfish> but she would not agree to it
11:37:48 <sbp> well that's a problem in RDF :-)
11:38:01 <bblfish> not when you use graphs
11:38:14 <sbp> but there is no concept of Graph expressible in RDF/XML, sadly
11:38:14 <bblfish> (I think)
11:38:19 <sbp> yeah
11:38:23 <bblfish> there is in SPARQL
11:38:29 <sbp> right, and in Notation3
11:38:34 <sbp> way for the future!
11:38:59 <bblfish> * bblfish I need to look how graphs get defined semantically in SPARQL...
11:40:22 <bblfish> still you can use schemarama2 type tools (that use sparql) to define your document types (the ones whose graphs contain certain types of relations)

13:14:21 <ndw> yep
13:15:00 <danja> reto's wanting to extract meta with jpegrdf
13:15:08 <danja> something like Model getMetaData(InputStream imageIn, String imageURI)
13:15:37 <ndw> Uhm, well...
13:15:37 <danja> is there a grab-exif-and-RDFise in there anywhere?
13:16:10 <ndw> Well, jpegrdf -s imageURI will return the RDF
13:16:30 <ndw> But that only works if you've added RDF...
13:16:34 <danja> right
13:16:42 <ndw> You can add RDF with jpegrdf -u imageURI
13:16:49 <danja> I *think* he's looking at untreated images
13:16:55 <ndw> Right.
13:17:13 <ndw> So you want the moral equivalent of jpegrdf -u -s but without attempting to write the RDF back to the jpeg, I think
13:17:51 <ndw> It wouldn't be hard to do, I don't think, but it doesn't exist today
13:17:58 <ndw> Well, not in jpegrdf, anyway :-)
13:20:14 <danja> hmm, bad memory, I could have sworn there were exif accessors
13:21:59 <ndw> Well, there may be, but jpegrdf is the only one I'm really familiar with :-)

17:28:38 <dc_swig> Added comment F2.
17:29:03 <timbl> Well, there is an API for a view of a query dataset, like map, calendar, ect , timeline
17:29:26 <timbl> It seemed to be quick for joyce to plug in the simile timeline
17:29:58 <danja> so if I wanted to add say a pet view, it'd be relatively straightforward..?
17:30:21 <danja> timeline's around there now too? wonderful.
17:30:40 <timbl> its been added but not announced ... maybe unfinished...

17:38:12 <EliasT> timbl, I'm trying an Atom entry stored in my RDF server queso on Tabulator and it doesn't work.
17:38:25 <EliasT> that's the URL -> http://abdera.watson.ibm.com:8080/atom/entry/edit/urn:lsid:abdera.watson.ibm.com:entries:556848407
17:38:37 <EliasT> do I need to enable the about:config permission?
17:38:52 <timbl> Absoluteley
17:39:16 <timbl> Go to about:config, type "codebase" in the filter, change the codebase support to true
17:39:16 <EliasT> I thought I did.
17:39:20 <sheets> * sheets is currently ripping the source fetching apart and putting it back together. GRDDL is a goal after this retooling (regardless of its current state)
17:39:28 <timbl> When you day i doesn't work, what happens?
17:39:36 <EliasT> yellow light
17:40:01 <EliasT> let me uninstall firebug.
17:40:19 <timbl> if it stays yellow, it is stuck looking up the reference.
17:40:31 <timbl> Check the log at the bottom
17:41:03 <EliasT> I'm not getting prompted for access.
17:41:14 <EliasT> worked!
17:41:31 <timbl> Hmmmm... is ttp://www.w3.org/2005/10/23/Atom the namespace for Atom in XML or for the Atom ontology, I wonder? it is 404
17:41:49 <timbl> worked but really slow?
17:41:51 <EliasT> yes... well we need to use this one http://bblfish.net/work/atom-owl/2006-06-06/AtomOwl.html
17:41:55 <EliasT> that'd resolve.
17:42:17 <timbl> resolve to RDF?

17:47:34 <fgiasson> is it normal that at: http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2005/ajar/release/tabulator/0.7/tab, I get: "<dig.csail.mit.edu>
17:47:34 <fgiasson> (Please see the Tabulator Help!) Failed to get privilege UniversalBrowserRead to open http://dig.csail.mit.edu/data, java.security.PrivilegedActionException: java.lang.reflect.InvocationTargetException"
17:47:42 <danja> timbl, that's probably the 5th version at the 5th URI across at least 3 domains...
17:47:47 <chimezie> I know more clients that use it than servers that respond to it
17:47:50 <timbl> No, I would not change the namespace from the offciial one, but get a copy of ontology put there.
17:48:02 <NachoAway> NachoAway is now known as NachoMan
17:48:27 <EliasT> we can't. that's the Atom XML namespace.
17:48:27 <timbl> chimizie, yes, that is true.
17:48:35 <MikeJ1971> MikeJ1971 has joined #swig
17:48:41 <timbl> Ah, Ok. That's what I wanted to know
17:48:44 <EliasT> we most likely will need a new home at w3c for the ontology
17:49:03 <timbl> Mauybe then get a new w3.org/2006/atom ns for the RDF work
17:49:14 <EliasT> In the meantime, I'm discussing with atompub working group at IETF to allows us to do some GRDDL hooking on their namespace.
17:49:19 <NachoMan> NachoMan is now known as NachoAway
17:49:46 <timbl> A, yes, GRDDL on the schema would be great.
17:49:53 <timbl> s/schema/namespace document/
17:49:57 <EliasT> I could modify my XML output to include a profile/transform element but that's just my server.
17:50:12 <EliasT> ... but mine outputs RDF anyways.
17:50:17 <EliasT> ... and JSON.
17:50:21 <danja> have you got up-to-datish XSLT EliasT?
17:50:26 <EliasT> nope.
17:50:32 <timbl> So have you got a bunch of data I should be able to exmplore wih tabulator, then?
17:51:08 <danja> planet rdf's foaf is fun: http://journal.dajobe.org/journal/2003/07/semblogs/bloggers.rdf
17:51:21 <danja> takes quite a few steps to get to timbl's post
17:51:27 <EliasT> it's not cross linked.
17:51:29 <NachoAway> NachoAway is now known as NachoMan
17:51:31 <EliasT> if you see there http://abdera.watson.ibm.com:8080/browser/sparql/
17:51:57 <EliasT> we have a few named graphs.
17:52:03 <EliasT> hit Get Results.
17:52:48 <danja> EliasT, I'm tied up at least until after the weekend, but if no-one else has done a recent xslt I'll do it
17:53:02 <EliasT> that'll be excellent.
17:53:08 <EliasT> I was going to ask David Powell
17:53:15 <timbl> (I wish Aaronsw would put a 403 on the rss ontology )
17:53:21 <danja> (I got up to about 2/3 of a version from months ago)
17:53:45 <chimezie> A push-oriented XSLT would be the way to go to (later) account for Atom extensions
17:54:47 <ubu_> ubu_ has joined #swig
17:55:28 <danja> chimezie, please explain..?
17:55:29 <ubu> ubu has quit
17:55:46 <chimezie> sorry:  i.e., more xsl:apply-templates and xsl:templates than xsl:for-each
17:56:01 <danja> the Semantic Media wiki works pretty nicely with tabulator
17:56:06 <danja> e.g. http://wiki.ontoworld.org/index.php/Special:ExportRDF/SWAP2006
17:56:13 <chimezie> where is a good push vs pull XSLT article when you need one
17:56:17 <chimezie> .g push pull xslt
17:56:17 <phenny> chimezie: http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2005/07/06/tr.html
17:56:23 <danja> thanks
17:56:40 <danja> I usually tend that way anyhow
17:57:01 <chimezie> Ahh Bob DuCharme as well - that should be a good one
17:57:52 <chimezie> * chimezie whispers: which is something you'll have a difficult time emulating in XQuery
17:57:59 <danja> yep, he's done some excellent pieces
17:58:41 <EliasT> SELECT ?o
17:58:42 <EliasT> WHERE {
17:58:42 <EliasT>   GRAPH ?g {
17:58:42 <EliasT>       ?s  <http://www.w3.org/2005/10/23/Atom#href> ?o
17:58:42 <EliasT>   }
17:58:42 <EliasT> }
17:58:51 <EliasT> if you query for that on my browser, you'll get a ton of links.
17:59:04 <EliasT> ... make sure you uncheck any graphs on the Graphs tab
17:59:29 <danja> * danja likens XQuery to Visual Basic with angle brackets 
17:59:37 <chimezie> is ?g bound initially?
17:59:43 <timbl> The blog stuff  isn't quite linke dennough ... ike no link from http://captsolo.net/info/blog_a.php  captsolo'd weblog to its creator.
18:00:56 <EliasT> no.
18:01:32 <EliasT> the query is against the entire server.
18:01:33 <chimezie> so does that query across *all* named graphs, or a 'default' one?
18:01:37 <EliasT> all of them.
18:01:39 <timbl> Fo rlinked data you have to include links in both directions when smeone asks about x
18:01:55 <chimezie> so it would be the same 'query plan' w/out the GRAPH ?g, then?
18:02:30 <EliasT> well... we are not adding all of the named graphs as default graphs.
18:02:33 <chimezie> I'm curious how other SPARQL implementations deal with partitioning of named graphs
18:02:53 <EliasT> so we have an introspection graph. the introspection points to all of the collections.
18:02:58 <EliasT> the collections have entries.
18:03:08 <EliasT> each introspection, collection, entry is a named graph.
18:03:24 <EliasT> I need to add backlinks to the entries back to the collection.
18:03:43 <EliasT> and from the collection to the introspection so we can navigate the entire server using Tabulator.
18:04:11 <chimezie> so even the top level graph (the introspection graph) has an identifier by which you can limit queries to the 'top-most' level..
18:05:12 <danja> EliasT, do you have a vocab for APP?
18:05:33 <danja> (is one even needed?)
18:06:04 <chimezie> oh, I see.. you have a flattened space of named graphs..
18:06:25 <kingsleyidehen> kingsleyidehen has joined #swig
18:07:42 <chimezie> (which is also how Oracle 10G spatial partitions named graphs)
18:07:44 <danja> nice mail on best practice docs btw chimezie
18:07:53 <chimezie> thx :)
18:08:28 <kingsleyidehen> timbl: re. Tabulator there is a sparql endpoint at: http://demo.openlinksw.com/sparql that contains a myriad of graphs that should look pretty interesting via the tabulator
18:08:43 <chimezie> * chimezie gives that a shot
18:08:46 <danja> oh mercy! httpRange-14 has made it onto public-semweb-lifesci
18:09:07 <chimezie> yeah, yet another thread waiting to unroll
18:09:46 <EliasT_> EliasT_ has joined #swig
18:10:04 <kingsleyidehen> We've also just completed support for SIMILE's Semantic Bank API so if you have an account at say: http://demo.openlinksw.com/ods or http://myopenlink.net:8890/ods you will be able to deposit Triples via Piggy Bank and then re-surface the data via the Tabulator
18:10:59 <kingsleyidehen> We are also near the completion of an Ajax based TimeLine control that binds directly to Web Services (SOAP or REST) which naturally implies binding to the SPARQL Query Protocol
18:11:03 <danja> nice
18:11:53 <kingsleyidehen> I will be unveiling some demos once I complete a final round of experiments (as these developments are all hitting completion points at the same time across OpenLink :-) )
18:12:55 <MikeJ1971> MikeJ1971 has quit
18:12:56 <danja> how do you point tabulator at a sparql endpoint?
18:13:20 <danja> or where is a good starting point from http://demo.openlinksw.com/sparql?
18:13:30 <kingsleyidehen> also note that we can now see Blogs, Wiki, and other distributed collaborative application data (that resides in the Virtuoso app. layer called OpenLink Data Spaces) via SIOC, FOAF, and Atom OWL (as I believe iv_an_ru and some of my other developers would have unveiled by now)
18:13:50 <EliasT_> that's mine http://abdera.watson.ibm.com:8080/sparql
18:14:19 <kingsleyidehen> http://demo.openlinksw.com/sparql/ is the endpoint :-)
18:14:21 <dc_swig> H: http://demo.openlinksw.com/sparql/ from kingsleyidehen
18:14:55 <danja> but how do you get starting nodes in tabulator?
18:15:14 <kingsleyidehen> likewise, if you have an account at: http://myopenlink.net:8890/ods it is: http://myopenlink.net:8890/sparql/
18:15:24 <ubu_> ubu_ is now known as ubu
18:16:50 <timbl> kinglsleydehen, hmmmmm.   virtuoso does loading of data as a query unfolds?
18:17:08 <kingsleyidehen> let me check a second as I came in here hoping that the SPARQL exposure was about to happen re. Tabulator
18:17:11 <timbl> "load data: * if there is no data for the URI , ..."
18:17:34 <kingsleyidehen> let me go check one more time as I may have just passed it my plain old RDF last time around
18:18:58 <EliasT_> timbl, I believe virtuoso and us are using the same Atom ontoloy.
18:19:12 <EliasT_> ... just not the same version, since it's evolving.
18:20:41 <kingsleyidehen> Does the tabulator's URI field takes a URI to plain old RDF and/or SPARQL Query URI
18:20:44 <kingsleyidehen> ?
18:21:08 <kingsleyidehen> so far I am able to give it plain old RDF which is accessible via Virtuoso's WebDAV entry point
18:21:35 <EliasT> EliasT has quit
18:22:10 <EliasT_> timbl, I tried this: http://abdera.watson.ibm.com:8080/atom/entry/edit/urn:lsid:abdera.watson.ibm.com:entries:1094302076
18:22:24 <EliasT_> and there are supposed to be some triples coming from RDFa in the FOAF Ns.
18:24:16 <kingsleyidehen> timbl: I am going to tuck my SPARQL in a Virtuoso Query Template (a resource that I can expose via a URI using Virtuoso's DAV)
18:24:44 <EliasT> EliasT has joined #swig
18:24:54 <EliasT_> EliasT_ has quit
18:25:17 <kingsleyidehen> danja: that's how you can bind to the Tabulator (using virtuoso) while we await a loose coupling from tabulator to sparql query services
18:26:24 <kingsleyidehen> danja: http://demo.openlinksw.com/sparql can push SPARQL to other SPARQL Query Services for processing
18:26:44 <kingsleyidehen> XMLArmyKnife amongst others worked fine during my tests
18:28:19 <kingsleyidehen> "Query Processor" field is where you switch Query Processors. And I think the tabulator can do exactly the same thing
18:28:35 <kingsleyidehen> then you have a major SPARQL explosion IMHO :-)
18:29:11 <kingsleyidehen> If SIMILE do the same with their TimeLine control, another explosion
18:29:15 <chimezie> * chimezie thinks it's about time to equip Emeka with SPARQL HTTP Protocol support
18:29:27 <kingsleyidehen> We are certainly adding this to our Ajax based TimeLine control :-)
18:29:46 <kingsleyidehen> Yes, my brother :-)
18:29:57 <Emeka> Emeka has joined #swig
18:29:59 <EliasT> I have an intern hooking up our sparql protocol with Simile TimeLine control.
18:30:26 <lkagal> lkagal has quit
18:30:47 <kingsleyidehen> EliasT: We have a pick an point UI builder that makes TimeLine and Map Services binding via Ajax a pick and point affair
18:31:00 <EliasT> cool. URL?
18:31:05 <EliasT> from SPARQL?
18:31:07 <kingsleyidehen> see: http://demo.openlinksw.com/DAV/JS/oat/index.html
18:31:21 <timbl> The remote SPARQL query isn't in this version of tabulator. Next release.
18:31:22 <kingsleyidehen> SPARQL is coming (talking hours)
18:31:34 <kingsleyidehen> Timbl: Ah!
18:32:11 <EliasT> kingsleyidehen: how many at virtuoso? 1,000 developers?
18:32:47 <kingsleyidehen> We get SPARQL support gratis since the OpenLink Ajax Toolkit (OAT) has binding to Web Services (SOAP and REST) and SQL (via XMLA which is a SOAP application for data access)
18:33:19 <timbl> There is code in Tabulator to do SPARQL -- in fact it uses it internally.
18:33:47 <timbl> You can make a query by selecting fields in the outliner, then edit the sparql, and redisplay.
18:34:20 <timbl> The question is how to tell it which URIs to look up on which SPARQL service.
18:34:31 <kingsleyidehen> So we can hit SPARQL Services due to the SPARQL Protocol (REST or SOAP which applies to Virtuoso and other Web Services based App. Servers) and also hit SPARQL (in Virtuoso specifically)  since our SQL parser understands SPARQL :-)
18:36:15 <Kriegel> Kriegel has joined #swig
18:36:40 <kingsleyidehen> timbl: you mean the graphs (default and/or named)? On a per SPARQL Query Service basis?
18:37:22 <timbl> There'll be something log    mySparqlEndpoint foo:servesPrefx   "http://whatever"
18:37:44 <timbl> which means tha the given endpoint serves infor about tings with URIs starting wit h "http://whatever"
18:37:54 <peace-kee> peace-kee has joined #swig
18:38:23 <kingsleyidehen> ElliasT: Virtuoso has about 5 core developers (if that) :-) The mileage come from the fact that its development started in 1998 :-) So you have a few guys working on something for a very long time :-)
18:38:29 <timbl> By the way, kinglsey, if I put "SELECT * WHERE  {<http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2005/ajar/ajaw/data#Tabulator> ?p ?o}" in virtuoso demo and ask it to load URIs, it doesn't sem to load anything
18:38:46 <kingsleyidehen> Let me check
18:39:34 <kingsleyidehen> what's the endpoint of the Tabulator's Query Service?
18:39:43 <joshlieberman> joshlieberman has joined #SWIG

18:41:11 <timbl> The data is on the web.  I don't want to upload it everywhere.
18:41:23 <timbl> Trying to load:http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2005/ajar/ajaw/data.rdf
18:41:23 <timbl> There was an error, when we tried to load "http://dig.csail.mit.edu/2005/ajar/ajaw/data.rdf".
18:41:23 <timbl> The error returned was:
18:41:23 <timbl> SR185: Undefined procedure DB.DBA.RDF_EXP_LOAD_RDFXML.
18:41:25 <dc_swig> Label SR not found.
18:41:28 <kingsleyidehen> so I need the SPARQL Query Service endpoint
18:41:54 <timbl> Oh, Ok, I'd have to cook up an XMLARmyKnife one or something
18:41:56 <kingsleyidehen> I'll take a look at the upload attempt (repeat it myself)
18:42:15 <kingsleyidehen> back in a sec
18:42:55 <EliasT> timbl, I have a SPARQL query service endpoint.
18:43:11 <EliasT> ... http://abdera.watson.ibm.com:8080/sparql
18:45:23 <kingsleyidehen> Timbl: Data is upload, graph name is <csail_data>, but the resultset is empty :-(
18:45:44 <kingsleyidehen> I need to go check what's up
18:46:14 <kingsleyidehen> I am going to repeat experiment against older server just in case this in a problem with the very latest build (which is what's on demo)

19:39:20 <kingsleyidehen> Interesting Turtle and/or N3 query patterns for SPARQL?
19:39:31 <kingsleyidehen> Hmmm...
19:40:45 <kingsleyidehen> "a" implies rdf:type :-)
19:40:59 <chimezie> sparql's grammar is a restricted compromise between N3 and Turtle
19:42:31 <kingsleyidehen> :-)
19:43:08 <kingsleyidehen> timbl: iv_an_ru should be fixing this now, he will ping once done :-)
19:43:54 <kingsleyidehen> isn't realtime collaboration great :-)
19:44:09 <chimezie> I forget if N3's grammar allows for BNodes as predicates.  as in: { ?a [] ?b } => {?a a :SecondOrderLogic}

20:25:02 <kingsleyidehen> I don't see anything wrong with the interface per se. I just want to know if this is a palatable interface to Virtuoso's Quad Store for those want to work programmatically with Virtuoso outside of ODBC, SPARQL (which is for querying), JDBC, ADO.NET etc..
20:25:32 <kingsleyidehen> without having to learn Virtuoso/PL (which itself is standards based, but Stored Procedures aren't considered cool these days etc..)
20:26:40 <yosi_lap> yosi_lap has joined #swig
20:27:00 <kingsleyidehen> for instance, someone trying to hook Virtuoso into Piggy Bank via the Semantic Bank API could use such an API into Virtuoso instead of writing Virtuoso/PL and then publishing the PL as SOAP or REST (trivial but has a political blind-spot to it)

02:28:21 <dmiles> [7:24:50 PM] Stephen Reed says: I have little time left so I'll type it:   We have to publish an OWL document for OpenCyc v1.0.  It would be helpful to also provide small OWL files for each term as described above.  Static file serving is easy for me.  I'll zip up one very large OWL document and about 200,000 small files and send over for hosting on the server.  Larry can discuss providing a sw.cyc.com domain name that can point to your server, 
02:28:56 <dmiles> [7:29:03 PM] Stephen Reed says: ... sw.cyc.com/2006/07/cyc#Dog where Dog.xml is the name of the file to be returned.  Some small servet will need to interpret the url - or use Apache mod_rewrite to dynamically modiify the url from http://sw.cyc.com/2006/07/28/cyc#Dog to something like http://sw.cyc.com/2006/07/28/cyc/concepts/Dog.xml

05:59:17 <Biblio> what's the relationship between rdfa and grrdl? is rdfa the way to embed info, and grddl the algorythm to extrat that info?
05:59:58 <ericP> rdfa is a(nother) language for expression RDF
06:00:27 <Biblio> hie, ricp. for embedding in xhtml, you mean, right?
06:00:40 <ericP> yup
06:00:53 <Biblio> what's grddl, then?
06:01:05 <Biblio> a mechanism to actually extract embedded rdf?
06:01:10 <ericP> grddl is a convention for association a transformation from whatever XML format to, iirc, RDF/XML
06:02:15 <ericP> you can think of it as, when you write rdfa, you are writing the triples in a language that some parser will be able to parse direction
06:03:18 <ericP> but when you write data some arbitrary XML language, you need to write something else that extracts that data into a form a parser will understand
06:03:24 <ericP> is this working for you?
06:03:34 <ericP> (late here, not sure i'm being clear)
06:04:01 <Biblio> i think i get it, yes, and thanks, ericp
06:04:32 <Biblio> main difference then would be that rdfa is just for xhtml 2 while grddl works for any generic xml format?
06:04:56 <ericP> right
06:04:59 <Biblio> but both cover roughly the same operation, namely, embedding and extracting?
06:05:22 <ericP> you would expect to find a parser to natively understand rdfa, as you would with RDF/XML
06:06:27 <Biblio> (I'm not familiar with RDF/XML, but i assume that is a way to code RDF into any xml, right?)

10:03:14 <dc_swig> Titled item A.
10:03:23 <danbri> A:by Li Ding, Lushan Han and Tim Finin at UMBC / Swoogle
10:03:24 <dc_swig> Added comment A1.
10:04:18 <danbri> A:By fantastic, I do not mean 'a work of fantasy'. The report summarises very usefully the roles and patterns in which the pieces of these namespaces show up in practice.
10:04:19 <dc_swig> Added comment A2.
10:05:18 <danbri> A:Interesting in particular the extent to which "lat"/"long" are used and "alt" isn't. I expected that, but not the extent: "The geo:alt property has been used by fewer that 20 documents".
10:05:19 <dc_swig> Added comment A3.
10:05:44 <danbri> A:I'll shut up now and save my thoughts for blog/email. Take a look. This is how SW vocab evolution should work!
10:05:45 <dc_swig> Added comment A4.
10:14:00 <Biblio> you seem enthusiast =P
10:15:45 <kjetilk> A: geo:alt wasn't too clearly defined up to recently, since it was without unit.
10:15:47 <dc_swig> Added comment A5.
10:17:36 <Biblio> danbri, btw, may i describe a possible new related idea, from a newbie perspective?
10:18:03 <Biblio> i see space data, time data...but not spacetime data
10:18:36 <danbri> am definitely enthusiastic --- too many ontologies get designed up front, without notice of how they get used
10:19:38 <Biblio> when seeing "views" in soft like tabulator or haystack (say space (maps), time (timelines), charts, etc), i see space and time, but no spacetime (i.e, timeseries data)
10:20:46 <Biblio> if that was considered, then we could have rdf based movies =P
10:21:44 <IvanHerman> * IvanHerman sees the next voyager episode: "lost in RDF spacetime":-)
10:21:52 <Biblio> lol
10:22:06 <iv_an_ru_> iv_an_ru_ has joined #swig
10:23:05 <Biblio> rdf based views do not need to be just static, do they?
10:28:12 <Biblio> has the geo vocab be extended to work outside planet earth as well? astronomers will be left out if not
10:29:22 <kjetilk> * kjetilk weeps and nods
10:29:46 <kjetilk> but then our coordinate systems can be rather nasty...
10:30:36 <Biblio> a default subset would work for earth locations, and an extension for bigger supersets
10:31:30 <Biblio> i assume astronomers must have already some way to deal with it
10:31:59 <kjetilk> I don't know how they do it in satellites
10:32:22 <kjetilk> but for observational astronomy, it is mostly Declination and Right Ascension
10:32:22 <Biblio> neither do i
10:33:03 <kjetilk>  http://www.seds.org/~spider/spider/ScholarX/coords.html
10:35:11 <kjetilk> but defining a coordinate system is very routine for physicists
10:35:23 <kjetilk> and defining transformations between them
10:36:08 <Biblio> true. call a few mathematicians and a few astronomers and let them sort it out, i say
10:36:17 <kjetilk> yup
10:36:27 <kjetilk> * kjetilk is an astronomer, sort of
10:37:05 <IvanHerman> hm, this reminds me of my own past as a computer graphics guys...
10:37:15 <IvanHerman> there were people working on relativistic ray tracing
10:37:23 <Biblio> mm, why don't you shape the idea up, then? open a small forum/wiki, write a bit, research some, call a few expérts to conbtribute?

10:40:59 <kjetilk> I would really like to work with semweb in astronomy
10:41:07 <kjetilk> there is so much that could be done there
10:41:16 <Biblio> great! go ahead, then
10:41:20 <kjetilk> NASA is doing a lot
10:41:23 <iv_an_ru_> BTW the lack of 'double with dimensions' datatype in all languages except Ada is very strange :)
10:41:28 <kjetilk> but there is the issue of money...
10:42:06 <kjetilk> but if anyone knows of a position in astronomy with semweb, ping me! :-)
10:42:37 <Biblio> kjetilk, why don't you bring it up with say timbl? there might be some way of research sponsoring, or something
10:43:12 <kjetilk> and if that happens, of course, coordinate systems will happen very fast, but I think lots of advocacy is needed first
10:43:34 <kjetilk> mmmm, I don't know if he can sponsor stuff like this
10:43:40 <giovannit> giovannit has joined #swig
10:43:50 <kjetilk> anyway, I was applying for a position with an astronomical data center
10:43:56 <kjetilk> it looked very good at first
10:43:59 <Biblio> NSF or NASA, via a little call from timbl, might provide some grant or something
10:44:02 <iv_an_ru_> Research 1-dimentional case first: Celsium to K and F :)
10:44:35 <kjetilk> and I think that whoever builds something like that without considering RDF has not been doing their homework
10:44:53 <kjetilk> NASAs CTO is advocating RDF
10:45:17 <Biblio> all science has tons to benefit from rdf, of course
10:45:22 <kjetilk> still, there needs to be interest further down in the organisastion
10:46:01 <kjetilk> speaking of which, has anyone seen bijan lately?
10:46:31 <kjetilk> the problem for the data center thing is that RDF is viewed as "advanced future technology"
10:47:00 <kjetilk> which is too risky to get involved in if you have to get the system running next month
10:47:25 <Biblio> semweb is coming. and fast. it is already time for big organizations to get into it
10:47:30 <kjetilk> yup
10:47:50 <kjetilk> timbl said something like that the semweb is in the 1994 of the web
10:48:17 <kjetilk> and given that my old astronomy department came on the web in 1995
10:48:26 <kjetilk> they'll give me a call next year :-)
10:48:41 <Biblio> start first =P
10:48:46 <kjetilk> hehe
10:48:52 <kjetilk> yeah, I tried
10:49:05 <kjetilk> but at least they know about it now
10:49:13 <danbri> danbri has quit
10:49:56 <kjetilk> if I had time, I'd write up a lecture about it
10:50:21 <kjetilk> but that has to happen on my spare time, which isn't abundant... :-(
10:51:39 <Biblio> about what? the connection between semweb and astronomy? if so, perhaps you can do things even with little time. for instance, instead of writing all yourself...why not simply start a forum/wiki, and call people in?
10:52:27 <Biblio> a couple of posts to astronomers mailing lists...then you just provide the place, and order a little
10:53:41 <kjetilk> I didn't go with a wiki, but I tried to open a discussion with historians of astronomy
10:54:19 <kjetilk> still, I pretty much have all my spare time booked until late october right now...

I mean if you're going to write URNsAndRegistries-50 at least get Section 2.1 right.... no one who actually understands what persistence means with respect to URNs and other URI schemes would have remotely written it that way or even mentioned

13:45:38 <DanC> a GRDDL WG member has done some coding to integrate RDFa and GRDDL, I think
13:46:34 <DanC> dmiles, it looks like Reed & co are _very_ close to making cyc browseable, but "sw.cyc.com/2006/07/cyc#Dog where Dog.xml" isn't browseable
13:47:11 <DanC> to make it browseable, you have to be able to just take the name of the term and look it up in the web and get something useful
13:47:32 <DanC> so the URI for Dog would have to be something like sw.cyc.com/2006/07/cyc/Dog#term
13:48:30 <iand> danc, other than your notes on breadcrumbs or the source of cwm, where can I find out more about n3's holdsDuring?
13:48:37 <dmiles> he said he'd generate it today .. which means in the next 8 hours.. they might set up a vhost of sw.cyc.com still .. ether way probly by next tuesday
13:49:05 <dmiles> specifially this is becasue no tools will even load the owl content
13:49:37 <dmiles> also with apache rewrite they are going to have some more URI options
13:50:13 <dmiles> examples are that you can ask it to make sure it gives good clean xml headers with the file
13:50:42 <dmiles> but if your goal is to concatente multiple terms then you'll want each entity bare
13:54:03 <dmiles> i kinda wondered why not just morge the OWLExport.java + WebSever.java or just set up a .jsp.. but they want something more static (for everyones sake) speed/no live image dependancy
13:57:04 <bblfish> bblfish has joined #swig
13:57:37 <dmiles> so cyc#dog is the current thing but since you know the whole document is "cyc" good thinking about the Dog#term or Dog#otherprop

14:01:43 <dmiles> those vocab docs must be a little out of date
14:02:43 <DanC> anyway, holdsDuring isn't part of n3 any more than dc:title is
14:03:04 <DanC> it's something I thought I was borrowing from cyc, but I might have been making it up
14:03:05 <dmiles> comment : 	[Def]"(subabstractions WHOLE SUB) means SUB is a temporal part (one of the timeSlices) of WHOLE, where WHOLE and SUB are both instances of SomethingExisting. Both entities and subabstractions are subabstractions of themselves. So the predicate subabstractions is the restriction of the predicate timeSlices to the domain, and hence also range, SomethingExisting.

14:07:28 <dmiles> i am starting an email thread also with Steve,Larry,you etc for this .. but go on about what is needed
14:08:04 <iand> * iand thanks danc for help and goes back to work
14:08:19 <dmiles> to some people browseable = XSLTs for it
14:08:45 <DanC> no, browseable in pretty much the same sense that a bunch of HTML documents are browseable
14:09:02 <DanC> i.e. you give me a URI to start with, and I look it up, and I follow links from there to other interesting stuff
14:09:23 <DanC> so if I start with sw.cyc.com/2006/07/cyc/Dog#term ...
14:09:48 <DanC> ... I'd expect to find, there, stuff like { <Dog#term> rdfs:subClassOf <Animal#term> }
14:09:51 <dmiles> *nod* you want it to point to Mammal#term
14:09:55 <DanC> and then I'd http GET Animal
14:10:07 <DanC> exactly
14:10:45 <DanC> now one interesting issue to consider... I gather cyc maintains uuids for all their terms. There's a question of whether to use those for the URIs, and just give rdfs:label of "Dog".
14:10:46 <bblfish> I wrote a little thing up concerning temporal relations: http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bblfish?entry=temporal_relations
14:11:32 <DanC> The cycl names of the terms are reasonably stable... I think uuids would be overkill.
14:11:56 <dmiles> peek at http://65.99.218.242:8080/RESTfulCyc/Constant/Retriever-Dog/siblings
14:11:57 <DanC> i.e. you wouldn't lightly go changing $#Dog to $#Canine, would you?
14:12:21 <dmiles> thats some live serviing experment we're doing

14:13:04 <dc_swig> Added comment B1.
14:14:18 <DanC> yes, that Retriever-Dog/siblings thing looks pretty close. Just tweak the XML so that it's RDF and use real (http) URIs where the guids are, and that would work.
14:14:46 <DanC> though... hang on... the URI you're using has Retriever-Dog , not bd58e24b-9c29-11b1-9dad-c379636f7270

14:14:58 <dc_swig> Added comment B2.
14:15:01 <dmiles> i think they are stable becasue a big naming effort is now completed so everyones still bouncing back and will be for a while
14:15:17 <DanC> so maybe you don't want to use the uuids as the uris
14:16:42 <dmiles> with single constant serving it makes it tempting to add everything
14:18:46 <dmiles> you might be interest in looking at the index page http://65.99.218.242:8080/RESTfulCyc/
14:21:10 <bblfish> I seem to have found a limitiation in N3, that SPARQL handles better
14:21:46 <bblfish> namely I don't think it is possible in N3 rules to specify that certain statements are optional...
14:22:21 <timbl> No, you have to break it into several rules.
14:22:42 <bblfish> :-) Ok, that can get to be quite verbose...
14:24:08 <DanC> optional is a complex feature. SPARQL hides a lot of complexity.
14:24:29 <DanC> the WG is still trying to figure out the semantics of optional. beware. There be dragons.
14:25:24 <DanC> "Create a Link between a Wikipedia URL To a Cyc Constant:" what is the semantics of the link? foaf:primaryTopic? or just rdfs:seeAlso?
14:27:27 <DanC> hmm... http://65.99.218.242:8080/RESTfulCyc/Constant/Shirt/specs  is like a SPARQL query SELECT ?TERM where { <Shirt#term> cyc:specl ?TERM }. By the SPARQL protocol, that query would get URL encoded and sent over the wire in the URL. It's restful, but messy. I wonder about some sort of mapping.
14:27:34 <dmiles> conceptuallyRlated (URLReferentFn URL) i
14:27:56 <DanC> conceptuallyRelated... pretty much just rdfs:seeAlso. Not enough for equality reasoning
14:28:13 <DanC> timbl, you were just talking about a listOf mechanism yesterday, yes?

14:30:45 <boneill> boneill has quit
14:35:09 <timbl> The listOf  menachinsm.   There is a pattern that instead of mllions of     :I  foaf:made  <paper63.html>  on myfoaf page, I have   :I   foaf:pubs   <pubs.rdf>.     Suppose we publish the relationship between foaf:made and foaf:pubs.  That would mean that any query processor (or user) would know that if I am looking for things of the form :I foaf:made ?x  , I can go load documents ?y where  :I  foaf:pubs ?y, and then get the infor from them.
14:35:42 <DanC> very much like "List the genls:" from http://65.99.218.242:8080/RESTfulCyc/ , timbl
14:35:49 <timbl> Is this a common enough pattern that it is worth making a URI for it and writing code?
14:36:05 <DanC> I'd sure like the cyc guys to do so.
14:36:11 <DanC> we could pick a URI to share
14:37:23 <timbl> like <http://www.w3.org/2006/link#listDocumentProperty> or something

14:41:34 <timbl> s/->/<=/
14:41:52 <DanC> ew... use owl:inverse: { dc:creator.owl:inverse link:listDocumentProperty foaf:pubs }
14:42:19 <DanC> and the foaf docs say that dc:creator is really creator name, and that if you want to link a document to a person, use foaf:made
14:42:39 <DanC> just fyi; I'm not sure I agree
14:42:48 <timbl> { [ owl:inverse dc:creator]  link:listDocumentProperty foaf:pubs }
14:43:11 <timbl> but yes, dc;creator is not what we want
14:43:28 <timbl> it was just for example of inverse
14:43:46 <DanC> oh.. you think the rule works the other way? i.e. the relevant document is exhaustive? hmm.
14:44:13 <timbl> no.
14:44:58 <DanC> { MADE link:listDocumentProperty PUBS. WHO PUBS PUBLIST. WHO MADE WHAT } => { PUBLIST.log:semantics log:includes { WHO MADE WHAT } }. # the exhaustive version of the rule
14:45:13 <CaptSolo_> foaf:maker is used to point to a creator uri
14:45:52 <DanC> that's sorta use-mention-buggy. foaf:maker realates a document to its creator; you can refer to the creator with a URI or a bnode
14:46:11 <timbl>  {? MADE link:listDocumentProperty ?PUBS.  ?WHO ?PUBS ?DOC.  } => { ?DOC.log:semantics log:includes { ?WHO ?MADE [] }}
14:46:15 <DanC> "point to a URI" is sort wierd.
14:46:33 <CaptSolo_> * CaptSolo_ is looking for a property to link a Person to Software (that a person is using)
14:46:34 <DanC> ah. so the doc has at least one. yes, I like that.
14:47:09 <CaptSolo_> we have vocabs for people (FOAF) and for software (DOAP) but not a link "i use (or recommend) this"
14:47:45 <DanC> indeed. one source of "I use (or recommend) this" data is the debian popularity contest.
14:48:16 <DanC> it would be quite nice to make that into semantic web data. (but then people would demand aggregates in SPARQL even louder ;-)
14:49:38 <CaptSolo_> DanC: and people would not mind sharing their favorite / most used apps
14:49:45 <CaptSolo_> just if there was a way to express that in RDF
14:50:26 <DanC> hmmm... didn't danja do an RDF version of hReview recently? maybe that would work?
14:50:46 <DanC> * DanC finds a 2 Jul msg with a pointer to http://micromodels.org/profiles/hreview
14:50:47 <CaptSolo_> there's a FFox extension that generates a list (in txt, html, bbcode) of extensions you are using
14:51:38 <CaptSolo_> a simple 'use' or 'recommend' would suffice
14:52:39 <larsbot> larsbot has quit
14:52:55 <DanC> * DanC can't quite grok the 'item' field in http://micromodels.org/profiles/hreview
14:53:09 <DanC> "item info : name and URI(s) of the item (fn || url || photo ) | hCard (for person or business) | hCalendar (for event)"
14:53:19 <CaptSolo_> hReview has 'rating' - that can be useful
14:53:36 <CaptSolo_> but most of other properties are not needed for this use case
14:53:52 <kpreid> kpreid has joined #swig
14:54:04 <DanC> while it would be nice to have a simple { WHO recommends WHAT } property, the best properties are the ones that are agreed by a significant community.
14:54:13 <CaptSolo_> plus an hReview does not imply that it's software i am talking about
14:54:17 <DanC> and the hReview community includes, for example, yahoo local
14:54:31 <DanC> I think you could use a doap:Project as the item
14:54:50 <CaptSolo_> yes, DOAP would fit nicely
14:55:25 <DanC> or you could use foaf:primaryTopic with a page about the software
14:55:27 <CaptSolo_> * CaptSolo_ is not so sure re. need for hReview here though
14:56:08 <DanC> well, you could make your own :recommends property and write rules to ground its semantics in hReview
14:58:16 <CaptSolo_> i would see main use in exporting directly to RDF
14:58:30 <CaptSolo_> though having ability to describe it in HTML in hReview would not harm

17:00:06 <danja> DanC, re. hReview: item is the subject of the review
17:01:23 <DanC> I sorta guessed as much; the profile document is confusing it talks about url/name/photo. which is it?
17:01:37 <DanC> an example would be good. I didn't get around to finding one
17:01:51 <DanC> I looked for "item" in the transformation xslt and didn't see it
17:02:51 <DanC> * DanC realizes this is on topic for grddl-wg and wonders about next steps for getting danja in there
17:03:00 <DanC> oh... crud... and we still haven't picked a telcon time.
17:03:25 <danja> yep, I'm still interested ;-)
17:03:47 <danja> the item text is an abbreviated version of what's on the uF wiki:
17:03:49 <danja> item info:: This required field MUST have at a minimum the name ("fn" - the formatted text corresponding to the name) of the item (an hReview describes only one item), SHOULD provide at least one URI ("url") for the item, and MAY provide at least one URL to a photo or depiction ("photo") of the item.
17:03:57 <danja> + some more blurb
17:04:08 <danja> . http://microformats.org/wiki/hreview
17:04:45 <DanC> ah. that's actually considerably more clear
17:05:19 <DanC> except for "url for the item". that makes perfect sense if the item is a web page, but less if it's a restaurant
17:05:50 <DanC> the url problem is pervasive across vCard, vCalendar, and lots of other IETF stuff
17:07:47 <danja> tthere hasn't been much discussion in the microformat community about bnodes and IFPs...
17:08:03 <fgiasson_> Oups, just read the current conversation: DanC: could be interested in reading this: http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php?title=what_is_the_problem_i_have_with_microfor&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1
17:08:14 <fgiasson_> interesting discussions with Technorati guys as well
17:08:31 <fgiasson_> fgiasson_ is now known as fgiasson
17:09:11 <danja> hmm, unfortunately the uF wiki page doesn't have anchors/ids
17:09:27 <EliasT> fgiasson: you should look at RDFa too.
17:09:57 <danja> CaptSolo_, I guess you could do app recommendation by making a review and giving it a high rating
17:10:45 <danja> the hReview profile, RDF schema and XSLT probably aren't in sync right now
17:11:09 <danja> Tom Heath and I did a bit of revision not long ago, I've not had chance to update
17:11:17 <fgiasson> EliasT: yup, I scanned the primer a month ago or so, didn't had the time to do anything with it yet
17:11:25 <fgiasson> quite interesting for sure :)
17:11:42 <fgiasson> specially with clipboarding
17:13:19 <EliasT> if you would like to play with a parser see http://torrez.us/rdfa
17:14:34 <DanC> EliasT, I think fgiasson wrote an XSLT transformation for RDFa. (unless I'm all confused)
17:14:44 <EliasT> really?
17:14:52 <danja> fgiasson, "there is no URI" - nice line
17:14:52 <EliasT> I think it was Jeremy Carroll.

17:17:06 <DanC> I'm like a cobol compiler that can't tell the difference between identifiers that match up to the 1st 8 characters... but my limit is 2. :-/
17:17:10 <shellac> shellac has quit
17:17:24 <fgiasson> danja: why? Any specific events? :_
17:17:25 <fgiasson> :)
17:17:43 <danja> fgiasson, an interim solution for the lack of URIs might be to add them to microformats using eRDF (except it's unlikely that many publishers will bother...)
17:17:44 <fgiasson> DanC: ahhahaha :)
17:18:24 <danja> DANC ;-)
17:18:59 <fgiasson> Could be a good idea, there is also something called UNAPI that try to resolve the problem, but really, I don't like the solution :)
17:19:02 <kingsleyidehen> EliasT: Is your sparql endpoint up?
17:19:07 <EliasT> yes
17:19:08 <DanC> anyway... EliasT, do you see Gandon's work on RDFa transformation in XSLT1?
17:19:21 <danja> fgiasson, just doing a demo using grddl, but the grddl engine needs the profile
17:19:47 <danja> fgiasson, hardly any of the uF stuff in the wild has a URI (or is even xml)
17:19:51 <kingsleyidehen> URI?
17:20:07 <DanC> grddl has several ways of making the link. do you have write access to the documents, danja ?
17:20:12 <kingsleyidehen> for endpoint?
17:20:22 <fgiasson> danja: definitely :)
17:20:27 <danja> nope, thrid party stuff - from technorati's search
17:20:34 <EliasT> kingsleyidehen, yes
17:20:38 <bblfish> * bblfish just read up on RDFa
17:20:41 <EliasT> DanC, I saw the email.
17:20:52 <EliasT> DanC: where is the XSLT?
17:20:52 <bblfish> * bblfish and xhtml 2.0
17:21:17 <DanC> . http://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/soft/RDFa2RDFXML.xsl
17:21:42 <DanC> GRDDL won't help you when the party publishing the document doesn't want to play.
17:22:22 <danja> right. that's why I was thinking of a non-authoritative flag
17:22:47 <DanC> C:his message refers to [http://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/soft/sweetwiki.html|SweetWiki] and from there we see [http://www-sop.inria.fr/acacia/soft/RDFa2RDFXML.xsl|RDFa2RDFXML.xsl]
17:22:48 <dc_swig> Added comment C2.
17:22:50 <danja> if there's a known uF attribute in their, it /might/ be intended that way
17:23:35 <danja> it's scraping, but I can't see any other way of leveraging the uF stuff in the wild
17:24:05 <DanC> er... non-authoritative flag? I don't see how that's useful. If you want to scrape something and publish the results as RDF, then you're free to do so. you can use dc:source to cite your source. But you can't say that the original author licensed the RDF.
17:24:16 <DanC> (free subject to licensing foo.)
17:24:48 <kingsleyidehen> ElliasT: http://abdera.watson.ibm.com:8080/browser/sparql/ ?
17:25:12 <fgiasson> so: cite and don't care for the rest... ;)
17:25:18 <EliasT> kingsleyidehen: http://abdera.watson.ibm.com:8080/sparql

17:26:28 <kingsleyidehen> EliiastT: you might want to add this to the esw wiki page
17:26:35 <DanC> hmm... you might want to publish a transformation without publishing the data. I think Brian McBride was talking about use cases like that. They feel wierd to me. I need to think of a nother name for that scenario so that people won't be tempted to mix it up with GRDDL
17:27:42 <EliasT> * EliasT excuses himself, doing two things at once.
17:27:45 <danja> * danja remembers name black hole in Cannes
17:27:48 <CaptSolo_> danja: but then it'll be an empty review as i only want to express the 'uses' or 'recommends' fact
17:27:53 <DanC> i.e. the consumer could say "yes, I want to use danja's transformation on the hReview published by yahoo local. I understand that yahoo didn't license the RDF data, but I'll take the risk."
17:28:19 <CaptSolo_> even better would be the listOf pattern mentioned earlier:
17:28:23 <kingsleyidehen> EliiasT: Nice to see: select distinct ?g where { graph ?g {?s  ?p ?o }} works :-)
17:28:25 <CaptSolo_> here's a list of apps i am using
17:28:33 <DanC> only 2, EliasT ? lightweight. ;-)
17:28:38 <danja> CaptSolo_, sure, why not?
17:29:05 <CaptSolo_> danja: that's a possibility
17:29:10 <danja> DanC, but I would like to include the information that this was unlicensed
17:29:18 <EliasT> I'm lightweight.
17:29:22 <DanC> include in which information?
17:29:31 <danja> sorry, in transformed data
17:30:17 <DanC> the transformed data is computed by the consumer; he accepted the risk/liability. he has no use for an non-authoritative flag.
17:31:13 <danja> but that way the transformation is lossier than it needs to be
17:31:49 <DanC> I don't see how...
17:32:01 <DanC> it's no lossier than if I look up in the sky, observe the color, and write { sky color blue } in RDF.
17:32:36 <DanC> I don't see how the non-authoritative flag is actually going to be used/useful.
17:32:57 <danja> say you aggregate reviews from uFs
17:33:21 <danja> into a common triple/quadstore
17:33:27 <EliasT> kingsleyidehen: give props to Andy Seaborne.
17:33:42 <DanC> well, then you'd better cite yourself as the source of the RDF data that is scraped rather than licensed.
17:33:53 <kingsleyidehen> EliasT:  You may need to protect against select distinct * where { graph ?g {?s  ?p ?o }}  or select * where { graph ?g {?s  ?p ?o }}

17:46:56 <danja> offhand I'd guess SPARQL is useless at it ;-)
17:47:21 <bblfish> yes. Because you have to know exactly what the format of your response is going to be...
17:47:52 <danja> dunno if anyone's done TSP with cwm/euler or whatever
17:48:46 <bblfish> Well I mean you can't even ask the question, because in SPARQL you have to specify the pattern that you wish to have returned

17:53:58 <danja> I was very impressed by 4suite for some python/xml stuff the other week
17:54:11 <benja_> benja_ has quit
17:54:39 <bblfish> Well I suppose it could be done in SPARQL:
17:54:40 <danja> considerably easier to get xslt on this mac than it would have been with xmllib2 etc
17:55:25 <daniel_larsson> Regarding GRDDL, has anyone used it for other XML formats (than XHTML), say DocBook?
17:56:23 <bblfish> SELECT ?path WHERE ?path a :TSPList;  :first loc:Paris; :last loc:NewYork .
17:56:45 <DanC> other XML formats... only for demo/spec purposes, personally. I gather other folks have done it for real, though. I'm trying to get them to join the GRDDL WG
17:57:10 <bblfish> SELECT ?path WHERE ?path a :CheapestTSPList;  :start loc:Paris; :end loc:NewYork .
17:57:27 <DanC> the 4suite XSLT stuff has matured? I had a bad 1st impression of it... maybe 3 or 4 years ago.
17:57:42 <bblfish> could ?path return a list?
17:57:58 <peace-keeper> peace-keeper has quit
17:58:14 <DanC> not with SELECT. with SELECT, ?path gets bound to one term. you could use DESCRIBE and let the server return whatever structure makes sense.
17:58:33 <bblfish> ah, I have not looked a describe yet.
17:59:00 <EliasT> bblfish, what do you do for day job?
17:59:01 <DanC> DESCRIBE is sort of a private agreement between parties. sorta iffy.
17:59:13 <EliasT> DESCRIBE is AWESOME.
17:59:29 <DanC> well, there you have it ;-0-
17:59:30 <bblfish> EliasT: I work at Sun
17:59:31 <DanC> ;-)
18:00:00 <EliasT> DESCRIBE has mystique
18:00:05 <DanC> let's just say DESCRIBE is incompletely specified. That's a feature if you want flexibility, but a bug if you want interop.
18:00:37 <bblfish> Well it looks like some way to return the contents of a list would be really useful in SPARQL
18:00:43 <DanC> I expect DESCRIBE to work better when we figure out more of the serviceDescription stuff.
18:00:45 <danja> DanC, 4suite xslt just worked
18:01:09 <danja> (though namespace handling in core python caused problems)
18:01:12 <DanC> list handling is one of the main postponed issues in SPARQL, indeed.
18:01:50 <DanC> * DanC hopes to see more "here's my latest idea for doing list handling in SPARQL" posts to sparq-dev
18:01:59 <danja> daniel_larsson, hopefully be doing some GRDDL on Atom next week

18:05:06 <daniel_larsson> I did some fiddling with GRDDL over DocBook, but I feel like reinventing the wheel regarding how to GRDDL XHTML (e.g. XHTML html profile attribute). It's not something I'd like to reinvent if someone did anything in this area before, which is why I'm asking :)
18:05:45 <danja> right. dunno if norm's had a crack yet
18:05:52 <DanC> the GRDDL spec has an analog to the profile attribute... it's an attribute. Can you stick attributes on the root of the docbook element?
18:05:58 <danja> can't remember any mention
18:06:13 <daniel_larsson> DocBook has the "role" attribute as an extension point

18:09:42 <DanC> daniel_larsson, please do send mail about your implemenation experience... hmm... the GRDDL WG doesn't have a comments list yet... I guess you should send it to both public-grddl-wg@w3.org and public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf@w3.org, ideally

18:23:28 <NachoAway> NachoAway is now known as NachoMan
18:23:28 <daniel_larsson> GRDDL has a generic way to transform XML documents through the dv:transformation property, but I would prefer the "profile" style, to indirectly define what transforms to apply. Hmm, perhaps there is such a property?
18:29:47 <danja> DanC, I've jumped the ieapp hoop
18:30:26 <DanC> tx
18:30:48 <danja> DanC, btw, do you know of any developments in the edu & outreach wg?
18:30:51 <DanC> daniel_larsson, the analog to the profile mechanism is to use namespace documents.
18:30:54 <daniel_larsson> I guess this is currently specific to the XML format. In XHTML, the profile property is used for this type of indirection. Hmm, no... the root NS can be used to pick up namespaceTransformations
18:31:18 <DanC> SW EO WG is in chair-recruitment mode still, unfortunately.
18:31:31 <daniel_larsson> Right, just figured that out. But that implies using the same transformations for every DocBook document.
18:31:35 <danja> thanks, it did seem quiet
18:32:24 <danja> daniel_larsson, any particular reason you wouldn't want that?
18:32:31 <DanC> er... well, if the transformation you don't have in mind doesn't apply to all docbook documents, then it makes sense to point from the documents that it does apply to , yes?
18:32:46 <DanC> * DanC wanders off to an appointment...
18:33:41 <daniel_larsson> Well, I have a set of documents being design documents, and another set being test specifications. Ideally I would want to point to a "profile" document for each of those sets, with different transformations
18:34:07 <daniel_larsson> Much like the profile attribute is used in XHTML
18:34:18 <danja> ok, what DanC said then ;-)
18:34:48 <daniel_larsson> I just want to avoid having to specify each individual transformation in each individual document :)
18:35:31 <danja> right, that's trickier... ;-)
18:37:34 <DanC> well, each document has to be self-describing. that's how the web works
18:37:36 <daniel_larsson> Right now I've fiddled with the stylesheet DanC wrote to extract what transforms to use, to also look into the document referred to by an URL in the DocBook "role" attribute, so I can say <article role="http://example.org/testspec">, etc. Which of course works. For my documents...
18:37:45 <daniel_larsson> oh yes
18:38:23 <DanC> ah... well looking in the role attribute is something that could be done with all docbook documents, yes?
18:38:28 <daniel_larsson> I'm just interested in the extra indirection
18:38:42 <DanC> i.e. you can put the smarts to look in the role attribute in the docbook namespace document
18:39:17 <DanC> at least... I think so
18:39:25 <DanC> * DanC really must find his 1:30 appointment...
18:40:26 <daniel_larsson> I guess what I'm after isn't a way to solve my "problem", but rather how others have solved it, instead of reinventing the wheel :)
18:49:53 <danja> I guess you could attach a common profile to the namespace, then use variants as needed in individual docs
18:51:51 <daniel_larsson> yep
18:52:07 <daniel_larsson> Though, I'm not in control of the namespace
18:52:17 <danja> oasis?
18:52:24 <daniel_larsson> yes
18:52:44 <danja> right, them gallagher brothers can be troublesome
18:53:18 <danja> might be worth running it by ndw anyhow
18:56:22 <daniel_larsson> I don't know how prepared the DocBook community would be to formalize on an RDF transform. Until then, using the role attribute, or an attribute from a different namespace will suffice
18:57:13 <daniel_larsson> DocBook 4 doesn't even have a namespace, which is what I'm using atm

04:21:14 <DanC> * DanC gives 4suite another go...
04:22:24 <dajobe> my achievement for this evening was getting DSPAM to work
04:22:50 <DanC> I don't envy anybody who has to manage spam defenses
04:22:57 <DanC> my personal mailbox is getting pretty spammy
04:23:07 <dajobe> it's pretty good once trained, 99.8%+
04:23:08 <DanC> Setting up python-4suite (0.99cvs20060405-1.1)
04:23:23 <NachoAway> NachoAway is now known as NachoMan
04:23:24 <DanC> er... now what do I do?
04:24:10 <DanC> * DanC looks in /usr/share/doc/python-4suite ... loses
04:24:42 <DanC> no link in the debian package description to a homepage
04:25:38 <DanC> * DanC finds http://4suite.org/index.xhtml
04:26:32 <DanC> $ 4xslt -h
04:26:32 <DanC> 4xslt, from 4Suite 1.0rc1; see http://4suite.org/
04:27:31 <dajobe> you might be interested that there's a very alpha apache mod_sparql sort of working
04:32:53 <DanC> oh?
04:33:04 <DanC> what does it use for a dataset?
04:33:41 <dajobe> it'll be redland-backed, we haven't yet done all that connecting up detail.
04:34:43 <DanC> does it do optional?
04:34:47 <dajobe> I'll wait a little longer to get things more beta than alpha, before I give demos.
04:34:55 <dajobe> as much as rasqal does, i.e. partially
04:35:02 <DanC> hmm
04:36:32 <DanC> any hope of addressing http://bugs.librdf.org/mantis/view.php?id=77 ?
04:36:42 <DanC> "OPTIONAL messes up query results"
04:37:09 <dajobe> it's certainly one I want to fix
04:37:25 <dajobe> but there are some crashes/DoS bugs that get higher priority
04:37:44 <DanC> ah.
04:37:57 <DanC> I sort of watch bug 77 as a bellweather of SPARQL maturity.
04:38:06 <dajobe> heh
04:39:24 <dajobe> I had to make a lot of internal changes for infrastructure to fix things like that.  Turns out evolving a query engine is rather hard, while keeping 'make check' working
04:41:54 <chimezie> DanC: John Clark keeps an updated build (http://infinitesque.net/projects/4Suite/docs/) of the 4Suite docs that is a pretty good all-in-one stop for documentation
04:42:58 <DanC> hi chimezie . right now, I'm just trying 4xslt on a random thingy that I usually use xsltproc for. Actually, a prerequisite fell over, so I'm fixing that.
04:43:13 <DanC> i.e. some of my code that builds the input to the XSLT job
04:43:25 <perigrin> perigrin has quit
04:43:29 <chimezie> oh , a package install
04:43:59 <chimezie> reminds me, I still have yet to give the latest Ubuntu a try
04:54:25 <DanC> wow... 4xslt pegged the CPU for about a minute before complaining that my .xsl file was empty
04:54:47 <DanC> $ time make mit-tel.rdf
04:54:47 <DanC> xsltproc \
04:54:47 <DanC>           --stringparam Class "200507mit-tel" \
04:54:47 <DanC>           -o mit-tel.rdf trxByClass.xsl qtrx93.rdf
04:54:47 <DanC> real    0m1.258s
04:54:48 <DanC> user    0m0.988s
04:54:50 <DanC> sys     0m0.142s
04:55:18 <DanC> that's after making trxByClass.xsl not empty :)
04:55:45 <DanC> $ wc qtrx93.rdf
04:55:45 <DanC>   555211   632751 11719349 qtrx93.rdf
04:55:50 <DanC> rather large data file
04:56:50 <DanC> ah... 4xslt args are in the opposite order from xsltproc
04:57:52 <DanC> grumble... how do I set a param?
04:57:54 <DanC> $ 4xslt --time --define=Class="200507mit-tel" -o ,mit-tel qtrx93.rdf  trxByClass.xsl
04:57:54 <DanC> In stylesheet file:///home/connolly/qtrx/trxByClass.xsl, line 11, column 6 in "q:Trx[q:splits/q:Split/q:Class=$Class]":
04:57:54 <DanC> Variable undefined: ("None", "Class").
05:08:45 <NachoMan> NachoMan is now known as NachoAway
05:10:44 <DanC> * DanC adds a missing  <xsl:param name="Class" />
05:10:58 <DanC> Transformation time: 8042ms
05:11:42 <DanC> and the output matches xsltproc
05:12:54 <DanC> so it's about 8 seconds for 4xslt, 2 seconds for xsltproc. prolly close enough for my purposes.
05:13:16 <DanC> hmm... is 4xslt pure python? does this mean I can implement GRDDL in pure python?
05:13:31 <DanC> the debian package says it's for i386
05:14:49 <DanC> dpkg -L shows several .so's, e.g. Ft/Xml/XPath/XPathParserc.so
05:14:53 <chimezie> I believe the processor is pure python, but the XML processor (Domlette) is C by default - but there is a Python alternative MiniDom
05:15:24 <chimezie> Syntax parsers are BisonGen-erated C parsers
05:16:21 <DanC> odd... the docs seem to live in /usr/share/pycentral rather than /usr/share/doc ; that's new to me
05:17:01 <DanC> er... maybe those aren't docs.
05:18:16 <DanC> wierd... there's a python-4suite-common package for arch-neutral stuff, but it only has stuff like .gif files and .xslt examples; they put the .py stuff in the i386-specific part.
05:19:13 <DanC> hmm... /usr/share/4Suite/Data/Rdf/4SuiteRepository.owl
05:21:10 <DanC> * DanC looks at it with N3 glasses... looks fine.
05:21:43 <DanC> ooh... a potential GRDDL txform... /usr/share/4Suite/Data/Stylesheets/xbel2rdf.xslt
05:23:23 <DanC> gar. 404 @ http://rdfinference.org/schemata/xbel/

05:25:27 <sheets> that whole domain is dead
05:25:37 <sheets> taken over by the marketing locusts
05:25:43 <DanC> quite
05:26:37 <sheets> sheets has quit

05:31:01 <chimezie> * chimezie looks around for chump bot
05:32:00 <DanC> ooh... "Chapter 5.6 is key for outlining an anti-looping mechanism for resolution-based inference as a model for backward-chaining proof generation."
05:32:01 <dajobe> not right now
05:32:03 <DanC> (from del.icio.us bookmarks for 2006-07-02 http://copia.ogbuji.net/blog/keyword/n3 )
05:32:38 <chimezie> Yeah, it's the only reference in literature to Jos' Euler path method
05:32:54 <DanC> I've been puzzling over the code that implements that algorithm for... years.
05:32:57 <chimezie> i wasn't able to decipher it from his ealier python code or the later prolog versions
05:33:40 <DanC> shame on me for not reading the thesis when Jos told me about it. :-/
05:34:01 <chimezie> It's very thorough
05:34:31 <DanC> sigh. comment spam in http://blogmatrix.semantic.blogmatrix.com/:entry:blogmatrix-2006-06-19-0003/

13:20:43 <stain>  if I have a named graph, where in particular each graph represent a transaction (of my filesystem). I name the graph using a URI (uuid)
13:20:59 <stain> the question is - where do I describe the graph/transaction itself? Is it kosher to include that in the very same graph?
13:21:33 <ronwalf> ronwalf has quit
13:22:03 <stain> I will use the named graphs so that I can serialize a particular graph and transmit it to the other nodes.. since each transaction is a graph this syncronizes well
13:22:22 <chimezie> yes, it depends on how much provenance information you intent to manage about each graph.  If it's substantial you may want to store it in a different graph
13:22:39 <chimezie> this is how 4Suite partitions it's named graphs of filesystem metadata
13:24:01 <stain> in a different graph?
13:24:04 <chimezie> i.e., associated with each graph is another graph of it's system provenance information (date of creation, ACL, creater, last modification ,etc..)
13:24:05 <chimezie> yes
13:24:32 <chimezie> same URI, different RDF DB (where by DB I mean a seperated collection of named graphs)
13:25:20 <stain> yes, the only important thing to note about the transaction is the creation date, user who created it, and node it originates from
13:25:22 <chimezie> so one RDF DB has the content, another mirrors the provenance data for each resource in the filesystem, both share the same URI
13:25:36 <stain> okai, yeah.. so you have the same namespaces, but different stores
13:25:41 <chimezie> yes
13:26:03 <stain> what is the advantage?
13:27:40 <stain> so graphs there can be modified
13:27:47 <stain> maybe that's why it makes sense
13:28:28 <briansuda> briansuda has joined #swig
13:29:25 <chimezie> well the primary advantage is partitioning the RDF space for query response for large volumes
13:29:51 <chimezie> and consistent reference to graphs (with the same URI) - which is important since the RDF content is of filesystem resources
13:30:43 <chimezie> the repository automatically manages corresponding graphs automatically: when the content is updated, the provenance graph is updated

20:06:21 <Biblio> timbl, you might (or might not) want to see this for your tabulator: http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2006-07-28.html#T10-17-36
20:09:41 <timbl> It it supposed to have data about that node?
20:10:17 <Biblio> i do not understand
20:10:17 <timbl> Oh, sorry ... I looked at it IN the tabulator
20:10:23 <timbl> * timbl looks
20:11:02 <Biblio> oh, i see, sorry
20:11:02 <timbl> Ah, spacetime.
20:11:13 <timbl> yes. we have wondered about that.
20:11:18 <timbl> Zoom around in 4D.
20:11:41 <sheets> we'd need Google Earth for that
20:11:52 <sheets> 3D, however...
20:11:59 <Biblio> just an idea, could be interesting for timeseries data =P
20:12:15 <timbl> One thought we had had was to put a slider on hte map veiw for time, and style differeently past and future point events on the  map.
20:12:50 <timbl> Would be nice for things like history of spreads of things, wars, diseases, democracy, etc
20:13:18 <sheets> timbl, are there geographic region predicates somewhere?
20:13:19 <Biblio> exactly
20:13:19 <timbl> There are some nice animated maps of history somewhere on the web -- I firget where
20:13:44 <sheets> like polylines with lat/long
20:14:54 <timbl> like http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/launch_ani_somme_map.shtml
20:15:46 <timbl> maybe
20:15:51 <Biblio> a slider for manually going to any point in the dataseries could perhaps be complemented with some kind of automated speed control, so the "movie" advances at some given rate
20:16:21 <timbl> yes.
20:16:55 <timbl> There is some tabulator test data of photos from a TAG roadtrip, wit lat/long and time
20:17:07 <timbl> * timbl has to go
20:21:54 <Biblio> if anyone here is related to simile (particularly haystack), might want to make them aware of that as well
20:22:18 <Biblio> sheets, perhaps you?
20:22:37 <sheets> Biblio, I'm working with timbl  on tabulator
20:23:01 <Biblio> both you and simile are mit based?
20:23:09 <Biblio> (yes, i was aware, thanks)

22:14:28 <quag> hmmm... #swig on irc.oftc.net is kind of empty :(
22:14:39 <sheets> sheets has quit
22:14:54 <quag> on the plus side, it means I have ops in there...
22:17:20 <libby> heh

22:19:01 <gromgull> gromgull has quit
22:19:17 <quag> hehe
22:19:34 <quag> so are you guys related to information retrevial?
22:20:03 <gromgull> gromgull has joined #swig
22:20:06 <libby> not exactly
22:20:42 <libby> I mean, we want to retrieve information, but not statistically
22:20:54 <quag> I only ask because I've been implementing a small system using latent semantic analysis and clustering in the last few days :)
22:21:15 <quag> is semantic web about describing data and relationships between it?
22:21:19 <libby> yeah
22:21:28 <libby> you could do that using stats
22:21:39 <quag> stats?
22:21:42 <libby> though I don;t know many who do
22:21:45 <libby> statistics I mean
22:22:12 <quag> hmmm... semantic web might still be useful to me
22:22:25 <quag> I've got a little system for tracking data
22:22:29 <quag> which uses tagging heavily
22:22:38 <quag> and the structures keep changing and evolving :)
22:22:52 <quag> (used to keep track of stuff I have to do) :)
22:22:54 <libby> interesting
22:22:56 <libby> heh
22:23:04 <HarryH> HarryH has joined #swig
22:23:08 <quag> rather a simple description :)
22:23:22 <quag> I've got about 450 live items at the moment
22:23:26 <quag> and that figure keeps rising :)
22:23:45 <quag> hence the clustering and analysis
22:24:08 <libby> that's a neat idea. I just keep a list that's like 2000 lines long
22:24:20 <quag> tagging is great for it
22:24:22 <mzeltner> mzeltner has joined #swig
22:24:30 <quag> although you have to do gardening :)
22:24:59 <quag> and it is cool being able to evolve the concepts and strutures as your understanding of the domain changes
22:25:24 <quag> tagging means you can have multiple competing models on top of the same data
22:25:30 <quag> and migrate easily between them
22:25:40 <libby> yeah that's quite semweb-ish
22:26:10 <quag> but it does mean that you are constantly gaining insight and being surprised by the models you have evolved :)
22:26:30 <quag> is semweb about creating schema that can interact?
22:27:56 <mzeltner> A large portion of the semweb is about interaction, I'd say yes.
22:28:06 <HarryH> HarryH has quit
22:28:30 <quag> if it isn't too much trouble, could you give me quick description of semweb?
22:30:33 <mzeltner> Do you like Haikus? ;)
22:31:07 <chimezie> chimezie has quit
22:31:19 <quag> mzeltner: not really :)
22:31:39 <quag> is there a good description of semweb in haiku form?
22:33:12 <mzeltner> Well, it's at least amusing. Anyway.
22:33:45 <mzeltner> What do you want to know, do you know any basics, for example about RDF and it's serialisations, or want a rough outline from the very core?
22:34:35 <quag> I've heard the name rdf before
22:34:43 <quag> and think of it as some kind of schema
22:34:50 <quag> but aren't too sure of that
22:34:52 <mzeltner> RDF is a datamodel
22:35:02 <mzeltner> It consists of triples
22:35:03 <quag> hehe, my bad :)
22:35:08 <mzeltner> subject, predicate, object
22:35:18 <quag> * quag nods
22:35:30 <quag> and everything is built up of these triples?
22:35:40 <quag> hmmm... sort of like hl7 v3
22:35:45 <mzeltner> Yes - that is really everything.
22:35:48 <mzeltner> hl7 v3?
22:35:51 <quag> where everything is built up of observations

22:36:50 <mzeltner> * mzeltner tries to remember the title syntax
22:37:09 <quag> the RIM model specifically
22:37:18 <mzeltner> Anyway.
22:37:19 <quag> anyway, I'm distracting you from your very good overview
22:37:26 <mzeltner> Example.
22:37:44 <mzeltner> <http://niij.org> dc:title "niij" .
22:38:10 <chimezie> there is actually a RIM OWL ontology which is a very good framework for general healthcare data as RDF
22:38:13 <mzeltner> That's a triple saying the resource http://niij.org has the title (from the dc namespace) "niij"
22:38:46 <chimezie> http://esw.w3.org/topic/HCLS/ACPPTaskForce?action=AttachFile&do=get&target=RIMV3OWL.zip
22:38:47 <mzeltner> Resources can be URIs, like above, or nodes.

22:39:04 <dc_swig> Titled item B.
22:39:05 <quag> chimezie: thanks :)
22:39:21 <chimezie> b:->swig,owl,ontology,hclsig

22:39:31 <chimezie> b:->swig,owl,ontology,hclsig
22:39:34 <quag> mzeltner: ok
22:39:36 <chimezie> B:->swig,owl,ontology,hclsig
22:39:37 <dc_swig> Set keywords for B.
22:39:51 <quag> oh, I see
22:39:57 <quag> so you can add notes for urls
22:40:01 <quag> using the bot :)
22:40:18 <chimezie> yup, very useful
22:40:32 <quag> damn cool
22:40:36 <quag> time to steal that idea ;)
22:40:58 <mzeltner> I think you can download its source ;)
22:41:57 <quag> what language?
22:42:06 <quag> * quag is downloading a bot framework as we speak :)
22:42:25 <chimezie> .g chump bot python
22:42:27 <phenny> chimezie: http://usefulinc.com/chump/

22:43:23 <mzeltner> So, returning to the rough overview

22:43:52 <HarryH> HarryH has joined #swig
22:44:07 <quag> heheh :)
22:45:20 <mzeltner> Information serialised in RDF is like a graph.
22:45:36 <quag> * quag nods
22:45:46 <mzeltner> The way an RDF graph communicates with the world outside is mostly URIs, as nodes are only available to the graph itself.
22:46:08 <quag> ok
22:47:41 <quag> hmmm... I could use rdf tripples instead of tags...
22:48:39 <quag> * quag reads wikipedia page on rdf
22:49:07 <mzeltner> Yeah, sorry, probably a better idea than listening to a tired mzeltner :)
22:50:49 <kpreid> kpreid has quit
22:51:10 <quag> hehe, you did a good job
22:51:37 <mzeltner> But that's not even 10% of what I was going to explain ;)
22:54:40 <quag> sure, but you hinted at enough that I went and checked the wikipedia page
22:54:59 <quag> instead of going off and hunting down the swig (code gen) guys
22:57:12 <kpreid> kpreid has joined #swig
22:57:57 <Biblio> do we have some canonical explanation of what the semweb is?
22:58:53 <chimezie> My fav - via http://infomesh.net/2001/swintro/: "The Semantic Web is a mesh of information linked up in such a way as to be easily processable by machines, on a global scale. You can think of it as being an efficient way of representing data on the World Wide Web, or as a globally linked database."
22:59:43 <Biblio> chimezie, thanks.
23:00:29 <quag> nice
23:00:41 <quag> chimezie seems like a useful guy to have around
23:00:50 <chimezie> :)
23:01:12 <quag> chimezie: are you involved with the health industry?
23:01:20 <chimezie> yes, I am
23:01:50 <quag> hehe
23:01:51 <chimezie> Cleveland Clinic, specifically
23:01:54 <quag> I am a little
23:02:02 <quag> I work for a small nz company

23:04:14 <quag> best hospital 2006 :)
23:05:47 <Biblio> quag, perhaps you'd like to know that there is a lot (and very active) people from the bio sciences working on semweb techs
23:06:23 <quag> Biblio: what are they using it for?
23:06:47 <Biblio> there is even a bio-specific mailing list at w3c, perhaps someone can provide the adress
23:07:20 <chimezie> yeah there is the public mailing list for the Health Care Life Sciences Interest Group
23:07:43 <chimezie> public-semweb-lifesci@w3.org
23:08:02 <quag> * quag does a little googling...
23:08:27 <quag> ah, so chimezie is a lead systems analyist at the cleveland clinic
23:08:56 <quag> hehe, chimezie becomes more useful by the minute :)
23:11:58 <quag> * quag kneels down and does a "we're not worthy" before chimezie 
23:17:56 <chimezie> Actually, google and del.icio.us are the ones you should be bowing down before

03:32:28 <dajobe> how do they deal with X?  where X is any other technology
03:32:35 <Biblio> does he have a "browser"? more than one? can he define his own datastructures?
03:32:51 <dajobe> right, so you are talking about user interfaces and visualisation
03:32:59 <Biblio> how many paradigm-shift are we introducing?
03:33:05 <dajobe> there are research you can look at in that are and software
03:33:34 <dajobe> that's another wide open question.
03:33:50 <Biblio> is there any group you know of working on that?
03:34:04 <idealm> idealm has quit
03:34:10 <dajobe> the research can be found mostly in workshops about "visualizing the semantic web"
03:35:17 <idealm> idealm has joined #swig
03:36:03 <Biblio> i apreciate the data, dajobe. it seems there is no group then.
03:36:05 <dajobe> some projects include trust on semantic web/mindswap, haystack/mit, mc schrafel's work
03:36:22 <dajobe> mSpace
03:36:48 <dajobe> and there's new stuff at simile/mit including tabulator
03:37:51 <Biblio> i have perused some of them, dajobe, yes. i apreciate the references, thanks.
03:38:16 <dajobe> that should give you enough refs and pointers to find groups, workshops, papers, software &c
03:38:32 <dajobe> * dajobe returns to redland bug triage
03:38:49 <Biblio> i have the distinct feeling that we are still talking of "this instance" or "that implementation", instead of having a group working at a whole big picture, with end-users in mind.
03:39:13 <Biblio> dajobe, thanks, nonetheless.
03:39:39 <dajobe> there's no single web development group either, or ever was
03:40:25 <Biblio> no wide range coherence was ever achieved either
03:41:02 <dajobe> let's not go over that argument again.  demonstrateably the web works
03:43:17 <Biblio> it works...badly. but since you were generous to answer, i will not pursue.

10:53:27 <Biblio> danja, hello. have you ever wondered how many paradigm-shifts could full semweb deploy? particularly, the impact on end-users?
10:56:29 <Biblio> has anyone ever compiled such a list? or written an "end-users guide to the semweb"?
10:56:40 <eleftherios> eleftherios has quit
11:03:51 <danja> nice idea, but dunno where the join would be between that and "end-users guide to the web"
11:05:04 <Biblio> well, ...what, and in what order, woiuld we need to present to Grandma and Grandpa's minds so that they could grok the semweb, and its full potential?
11:05:11 <Biblio> how simple could we make it?

11:51:27 <danja> hmm, the metadata side isn't too tricky -
11:52:40 <danja> the current web is like a library without a decent index (except a very shortsighted librarian called Google)
11:52:49 <danja> semantic web adds the index
11:53:18 <danja> but getting the notion of "it's about real things" across could be tricky
11:53:36 <Biblio-> i agree
11:53:50 <Biblio-> furthermore, we need a good, and uniform language to describe that
11:54:06 <danja> I can't think of any useful real-world analogies
11:54:22 <Biblio-> "items"? "data objects"? "objets"? "datastructures"?
11:54:42 <danja> "we need a good, and uniform language"?
11:55:08 <Biblio-> i reckon we seriously need to unify descriptive language, yes
11:55:27 <Biblio-> i listed some, people are probably already using even more
11:56:18 <Biblio-> "entities"? "resources"?
11:57:10 <mzeltner> I don't think you should talk about language when you want to describe the SW to my grandmother.
11:58:00 <mzeltner> One would need to get rid of the abstraction and go with analogies.
11:58:10 <Biblio-> mzeltner, i was pointing that even before we could start, we better choose some unfied vocab for describing things
11:58:32 <danja> you mean human vocab, I take it
11:58:53 <danja> - if so, why does it have to be unified?
11:59:06 <Biblio-> yes, some way of calling things like "people, emails, notes, bookmarks, etc etc
11:59:24 <Biblio-> more generally, any datastructure
11:59:43 <danja> things and relationships between things?
11:59:57 <Biblio-> probably the best we could do, yes

12:00:44 <dc_swig> C: http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bblfish?entry=rdf_and_metcalf_s_law from bblfish
12:01:05 <bblfish> C:| "RDF and Metcalf's law"
12:01:07 <dc_swig> Titled item C.
12:01:55 <mzeltner> In my experience, it's even tough talking about "things" as it's such a broad term. It's easier to take a concrete example and then state "Now, the E-mail can be just about anything, a car, a washing machine, your bookmarks"
12:02:33 <bblfish> I am thinking of things the way Quine did, as the value of a bound variable
12:05:30 <Biblio-> on top, we have the problem that we have the chance to almost completely getting rid of "files" and "folders"
12:05:56 <kpreid> kpreid has quit
12:08:19 <Biblio-> if we could also have a URN -> URL DNS like resolver...we could make the whole issue of the physical layer of storing data completely transparent to end users, both locally, via data atores, and net-wide, via URN's
12:08:41 <bblfish> Like atom ids?
12:08:47 <Biblio-> goodbye physical layer, hello logical layer
12:10:33 <Biblio-> bblfish, i want to be able to write <a href="The Wichita Report"">The Wichita Report</a>. note the absence of a URL, i just write a name...a URN
12:10:52 <bblfish> that's silly
12:11:15 <bblfish> the urn is ok.
12:12:15 <Biblio-> which part is silly?
12:13:02 <bblfish> Oh I wrote about this here: http://bblfish.net/blog/page6.html#49
12:13:42 <bblfish> I think urns would be ok for books. But I also think that failing that it would be better to work with URLs.
12:15:05 <bblfish> Also there are so much more important things to do. URLs have one very big advantage: they can be self documenting.
12:15:30 <bblfish> see: http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bblfish?entry=names_and_memes

12:16:03 <Biblio-> bblfish, are you aware that we were talking about something before you came in?
12:16:14 <bblfish> yes, I checked it up
12:16:30 <bblfish> Just pointing out that urns as names is an old story
12:17:00 <bblfish> and that urls have a big advantage: being self documenting. You can GET their meaning (if things are set up properly)
12:18:14 <Biblio-> how would you do that? and why a URN could not?
12:18:58 <bblfish> GET my meaning? http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/bblfish?entry=get_my_meaning
12:20:49 <Biblio-> if there is a difference i don't get it
12:21:24 <bblfish> well you can't GET a urn
12:21:42 <bblfish> unless you re-invent DNS for urns
12:22:21 <Biblio-> what does "GET" mean?
12:22:27 <bblfish> HTTP GET
12:22:37 <bblfish> it's what you do when you get a web page
12:23:03 <bblfish> the client opens up a connection to the server and does a GET /page HTTP/1.1 request
12:23:18 <bblfish> the whole web is built on that
12:23:25 <Biblio-> guess we would have to redo the DNS-like thing for URN's, then
12:24:01 <bblfish> which is a lot of work.
12:24:08 <bblfish> see the recent article by Norman Walsh: http://norman.walsh.name/2006/07/25/namesAndAddresses
12:24:22 <sbp> and you'd end up with more or less what we have now
12:25:57 <Biblio-> (reading, thanks)
12:34:40 <Biblio-> mm, i read it superficially, i'll reread it more carefully later. but at first sight, i saw no argument whatsoever why such thing would not work, or why it would not be desirable. in fact, i think i detect a few nonsequiturs
12:35:15 <Biblio-> "i will have to pay for a new domain"  <--example
12:35:38 <Biblio-> "the organization caring for the DNS system will outlast any other"  <--another
12:37:45 <Biblio-> as for "we will end up with almost the same thing" kind of arguments..would we? this names are location independent
12:39:27 <Biblio-> id the advent of data stores mean that we get storing withour caring where objects get physically stored..then the URN thing might mean something equivalent, but web wide, which would be consistent.

15:22:45 <chimezie> You can identify HTTP data sources / sinks from xforms:submissions, accepted mime-type of those sources, and the names of document fragments (IDs of XForms instance documents) - some of which are 'bound' to form controls

09:38:41 <Biblio> side commentary: do syntax-higliters in our editors (yes, the colouring schemes) allow for different colourings of different namespaces?
09:38:48 <Biblio> if not, i reckon they should
09:39:36 <Biblio> on top, now we will be introducing rdf, grddl, rdfa, whatever. should they be aware of semantic web extra level of markup as well?
09:40:08 <Biblio> as documents get more complex, those small details might get more important, i think
09:40:13 <giovannit> giovannit has quit
09:41:56 <Biblio> perhaps even a small note-recomendation could be a good idea, to avoid each vender doing something different
09:42:50 <IvanHerman> biblio: i wonder whether there would be enough colours ...
09:43:17 <IvanHerman> seriously: I would rather see editors giving me a flexible possibility so that I could choose which namespace I want highlighted
09:43:48 <IvanHerman> I use jEdit, which has a syntax highlighting
09:44:05 <IvanHerman> but it only has a limited number of 'highligh' possibilties
09:44:36 <IvanHerman> and it is hidden in obscure xml files somewhere in some preference files
09:45:00 <IvanHerman> a nice user interface would be nice...
09:45:36 <Biblio> very true
09:46:04 <Biblio> a small rec omandation should include a description of options to set it up as well, i think
09:46:17 <Biblio> <IvanHerman> seriously: I would rather see editors giving me a flexible possibility so that I could choose which namespace I want highlighted  <--yes, i was thinking just like you
09:48:48 <IvanHerman> actually... regardless of rdf namespaces or even xml: I hate the fact that each editor has its own way of describing how syntax highlighting is done; whenever I change editors I have to start from cratch understanding it if I want to adapt it to my need. Life is really too short for this... but this goes out of swig...
09:49:13 <IvanHerman> s/cratch/scratch/
09:49:22 <Biblio> exactly. which is why i suggested a little note-recomendation, perhaps
09:49:29 <Biblio> just a guide
09:50:03 <Biblio> (it is slightly off topic, yes, i know)
09:50:17 <IvanHerman> yes, that might be nice (putting on my pessimistic hat: would editor writers ever listen? It would lead to the 'not invented here' syndrome...:-)
09:51:29 <Biblio> ivan...it's a risk, yes. but then again...it might work, with a bit of evangelism. specially if pluggable code is already provided
09:52:10 <IvanHerman> i agree

10:02:52 <Biblio> i ask myself often what do we need so that the semweb goes really mainstream
10:03:19 <Biblio> other than specs (notably sparql+sparwl protocl), i wonder particularly about software
10:03:42 <Biblio> i think we need basically a data atore, and a client app (like a browser)
10:04:42 <Biblio> i also think w3c should make this soft, this time.
10:05:00 <Biblio> free, open source, multiplatform, of course
10:05:39 <Biblio> both libreries that could be used by anyone else, *and* a full, complete working app
10:05:46 <ndw> ndw has joined #swig
10:06:40 <Biblio> otherwise, we get locked in the "specs are fine, but vendors do whatever they want" syndrome
10:07:35 <Biblio> which, considering that the semantic web is a whole new game, with far more space for misundertandings, is pretty grave.
10:09:32 <bengee> Biblio, have you considered putting your braindump on a blog post and use a (single-line) chump for #swig?
10:09:56 <bengee> or use pastebin, if you don't have a blog
10:10:42 <PhUrl> why is SUMO.owl#Encoding a subclass of SUMO.owl#Writing and not a subprocess?
10:11:05 <ndw> ndw has quit
10:11:06 <PhUrl> does that mean that a subclass is to be interpreted as subprocess if the parent is a process?
10:12:57 <Biblio> bengee, yes. the problem is that since i'm no expert, and ideas are not quite full yet, i sort of seek for fast, early feedback
10:12:57 <PhUrl> like if ?child  rdfs:subClassOf    ?parent
10:13:54 <Biblio> bengee, you reckon is not appropiate behaviour?

16:47:51 <DanC> well, that would be nice... but you can't fault individual developers for being clueless; that's the default state. I expect the community center, CPAN, to do something about it.

16:48:39 <NachoMan> it takes a long time before people bring out the clue-by-four

16:50:29 <DanC> hmm... there's supposed to be a bunch of RDF data in http://rdf.insee.fr/geo/ ; any lang="fr" types around?

16:52:44 <dajobe> librdf-perl is the redland perl bindings debian package
16:52:51 <dajobe> unrelated to RDF::Core the CPAN module
16:54:45 <perigrin> * perigrin hopes people will learn to get on the RDF::Helper bandwagon and this whole argument becomes moot.
16:54:50 <dajobe> I was tinkering with redland/raptor's grddl support and I've made it read embedded RDF, DC and hReview using XSLT transforms mostly on w3.org - are there any others I should know about?
16:54:56 <perigrin> er s/argument/issue/
16:58:56 <DanC> have you tried the grddl tests, dajobe ? esp. the ones that test the namespace/profile indirection and such?
16:59:21 <DanC> most embedded RDF docs use the profile, so I guess you're doing that now?
17:01:28 <dajobe> I tried some of the tests, not in a rigourous fashion - i.e. automated and in the sources
17:01:28 <`miguel> `miguel has joined #swig
17:01:35 <AndyS> AndyS has left #swig
17:02:08 <dajobe> anything that uses the grddl profile mechanism alreayd works, I added a feature to recognise any microformat markup or whatever (<link> in dc style) and then apply a well known XSLT URi transform
17:02:52 <dajobe> although matching //*@class="event" is dubious, nobody uses the microformat mechanism, and if 0 triples are generated, it does no harm
17:03:01 <dajobe> class="vevent"
17:03:23 <dajobe> .. the microformat profile mechanism ...
17:03:56 <kjetilk_> DanC: if you really want to create a debian package of RDF::Core, it is usually quite easy to make debs from CPAN packages
17:04:01 <kjetilk_> dh-make-perl --build --cpan RDF::Core
17:04:06 <kjetilk_> should do it
17:05:14 <DanC> support for profile in redland is new since Apr 2005, yes? http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdf-in-xhtml-tf/2005Apr/0001.html
17:06:00 <dajobe> I'm not sure I understand the question
17:06:43 <DanC> Apr 2005 is when you announced some support for GRDDL in redland. At the time, it did only one level of transformation; it didn't go try to find transformations linked from namespace/profile documents.
17:08:50 <EliasT> EliasT has joined #swig
17:09:51 <dajobe> ah, the recursive thing
17:10:07 <dajobe> I'm still dubious about that, and how to prevent it going off and loading the whole web
17:10:37 <DanC> how do you support embedded RDF?
17:11:39 <dajobe> the microformat profile doc http://gmpg.org/xfn/11 still doesn't have any grddl that I could see
17:11:40 <mlinksva> mlinksva has joined #swig
17:12:47 <DanC> right; the XFN profile still isn't GRDDL-happy. I think part of the issue is that the GRDDL transformation I have provided produces foaf, and the XFN folks aren't all that happy about foaf.
17:12:55 <dajobe> it recognises the embedded RDF profile using xpath and applies a well known transform that ian wrote
17:13:27 <DanC> ah. so it has special support for embedded RDF. oh well.
17:13:51 <DanC> loading the whole web? that's a security risk, I suppose, but it real cases, there aren't going to be a large number of levels of indirection.
17:14:21 <dajobe> sure, I said it did a short list of things by recognising them
17:14:49 <DanC> so it'll fail some of the GRDDL tests, I think
17:15:01 <dajobe> sure
17:16:25 <DanC> hmm... but if a document directly links to a transformation, your implementation does grab and run arbitrary untrusted XSLT code.
17:16:47 <dajobe> yeah, and you mostly wrote that untrusted XSLT ;)
17:16:47 <DanC> it would make sense to only run blessed/known/trusted XSLT code
17:16:53 <beobal_> beobal_ has joined #swig
17:17:03 <dajobe> I was wondering about embedding the xslt
17:17:15 <dajobe> but then I pondered CC licensed XSLT embedded in software in gpl/apache2
17:17:29 <dajobe> the answer I think requires a lawyer
17:18:10 <DanC> Is any of my XSLT not also w3c-licensed?
17:18:44 <DanC> * DanC thinks it would be kinda cool to go over some well-known licensing cases and develop N3 rules to model them
17:19:17 <dajobe> it was one of the microformat ones IIRC
17:19:32 <DanC> the microformat ones don't produce RDF, AFIAK
17:19:40 <DanC> oh...
17:19:43 <DanC> hm...
17:19:46 <dajobe> from http://esw.w3.org/topic/MicroModels
17:20:31 <dajobe> this has no license and your RCSID: http://www.w3.org/2000/06/dc-extract/dc-extract.xsl
17:20:34 <DanC> hmm... glean-hcal.xsl says CC and doesn't say W3C license
17:20:44 <dajobe> right, that must be it
17:21:17 <dajobe> I've already bugged danny about all the broken links to transforms he once hosted
17:21:23 <DanC> I haven't developed a habit of explicitly licensing every bit of code I write
17:21:50 <dajobe> but anyway...  I'll probably do the head profile retrieval.  I was just doing this "for fun"
17:22:21 <dajobe> should be able to set up sparql quering events on tantek's blog... ;)
17:22:48 <DanC> * DanC is always unsure how much scraping is best, during the adoption phase

17:26:41 <kasei> and it ends up makeing RDF on perl look worse than it should.
17:26:44 <dajobe> reminds me, I gave some more info on the redland bug re the CPAN packaging - you were interested IIRC

17:34:16 <dajobe> a package with just the perl binding in a CPAN style would also be possible and a lot easier, it would have to assume redland was already installed which might not be The Perl Way.  Although what that is in 2006, I'm not sure
17:34:37 <kasei> heh. i just submitted almost exactly that wording as a note to the bug.
17:34:50 <kasei> that's the strategy taken by things like XML::Parser.
17:35:09 <dajobe> fair enough, that would certainly be easier to maintain
17:35:14 <kasei> which can be a hassle, but if it meant a quicker fix to the CPAN issue, I'd be for it.
17:35:50 <beobal> beobal has quit
17:36:38 <dajobe> in that case, starting from the bindings tarball, delete all dirs but 'perl' and maybe 'docs' then edit the top level Makefile.PL, Makefile.perl to remove the build-redland steps

17:43:10 <dajobe> adding's ok, but I'm not very willing to make backwards incompatible changes.
17:43:45 <kasei> no, i wouldn't expect so. I don't think that will be necessary.
17:44:10 <kasei> perl, being the very mutable language that it is :)

19:44:19 <dajobe> it seems to be working for me with a recent firefox
19:44:36 <dajobe> I have mozex 1.07.1
19:44:59 <DanC> * DanC just installed that
19:45:10 <dajobe> maybe not that recent a firefox - 1.5.0.early
19:45:16 <DanC> * DanC estimates the cost of restarting firefox...
19:45:35 <dajobe> that's what I keep sessionsaver around for

20:45:25 <chimezie> bblfish: the mathematical grounding you are looking for (in that post) attributes of Graphs (from Graph theory): order and size
20:46:42 <bblfish> ok. I have a book on graph theoryu
20:46:47 <bblfish> I still need to read it
20:46:49 <chimezie> RDF graphs (and semantic networks in general) normally have more size (links) than order (number of nodes)
20:47:23 <bblfish> ah, ok I did not understand that meaning of order
20:47:50 <chimezie> in addition, if you consider node degrees (the relationship of incoming arcs to outgoing arcs) you can probably identify some other interesting characteristics using Graph theory terminology
20:48:45 <chimezie> is the one you have, this one (by any chance): http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/3540261826/002-3755975-0252814?v=glance&n=283155 ?
20:48:54 <chimezie> that's a keeper
20:49:49 <bblfish> I was told about "Data structures and network Algorithms" by Robert Endre Tarjan (which I have right here)
20:50:35 <bblfish> this one: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0898711878/sr=8-1/qid=1154379069/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-8976305-9383907?ie=UTF8
20:52:11 <bblfish> phew. Crazy so much to learn
20:52:22 <DanC> say, chimezie, did you say you were interested in formats other than RDF/XML for GRDDL transformations? I'm curious about why
20:53:12 <bblfish> (one thing I am curious about is the relation between graphs and category theory...)
20:53:22 <chimezie> well.. XSLT (as the transform mechanism) can support transformations to other non-XML formats (N3 derivatives)
20:54:12 <DanC> well, yes, so? why complicate life?
20:54:15 <DanC> i.e. life for the consumer?
20:54:21 <DanC> (and for the WG ;-)
20:54:48 <chimezie> the issues with RDF/XML are well known, so unless it is an issue of compliance, there seems to be plenty value in supporting other transformation targets - concise formats, quicker parse, etc..
20:55:16 <DanC> er... well, it is an issue of compliance, i.e. standardization
20:55:57 <chimezie> yes, I figured that would be the main knock against anything other than RDF/XML as the output of a GRDDL transformation
20:56:23 <bblfish> standards don't have to close doors, do they?
20:56:40 <chimezie> i would hope they don't
20:56:58 <chimezie> the fact that SPARQL includes a subset of Turtle seems to suggest that they don't..
20:57:03 <DanC> in some sense, which RDF serializations to standardize is like the question of which transformation language to standardize. In theory, any sufficiently expressive format is fine. In practice, we'll probably need to endorse (and test and document) some formats more than others.
20:57:36 <DanC> it is costing the SPARQL WG hundreds of person-weeks to standardize that subset of turtle.
20:57:58 <DanC> hmm... hundreds of person-days, at least.
20:58:22 <chimezie> i'd argue it's well worth the effort - but that would be tongue in cheek
20:58:47 <DanC> well, the WG agrees that it's worth the effort. (it's an explicit goal of the WG to have a "human friendly syntax")
20:58:57 <chimezie> i was thinking more along the line of endorsement than requirment
20:59:09 <chimezie> helpful advocacy for the alternative formats
20:59:33 <DanC> well, that advocacy complicates life for GRDDL consumers, yes?
21:00:03 <DanC> "you told me turtle is cool, but the gahoo GRDDL service doesn't grok. what gives?"
21:00:27 <chimezie> not if they are aware of what is being produced for them..
21:01:20 <DanC> anyway... I can sort of see the appeal of other formats in theory... do you have any particular scenario where the difference is really important?
21:02:02 <chimezie> not really.. just the general idea crossed my mind
21:02:46 <DanC> ok, well, full disclosure: it's sorta my job to say "if there's no clear and present need, let's punt so we can get done on time."
21:02:47 <bblfish> I find transform to turtle more beautiful
21:03:22 <chimezie> understood, there are actually other issues that I'm interested in that are definately less urgent
21:03:36 <chimezie> er.. more urgent
21:04:48 <DanC> turtle is nice in a lot of ways, but I can write XSLT to merge to RDF/XML documents in about 10 lines, where I'd need hundreds and hundreds of lines for a turtle parser.
21:05:00 <DanC> s/merge to/merge two/
21:05:40 <bblfish> ? don't you just
21:05:40 <bblfish> cat doc1 doc2
21:05:59 <DanC> no; thanks to the joys of XML, the concatenation of two XML documents is not an XML document.
21:06:22 <bblfish> ah, sorry, I meant with turtle
21:06:34 <bblfish> cat doc.ttl doc2.ttl (nearly)
21:06:50 <DanC> nobody's quite sure what happens when you concatenate two turtle documents; the question of whether all the @prefix decls have to be at the top or not isn't really settled. (as far as I know)
21:07:18 <DanC> and you certainly can't cat doc1.xml doc2.ttl
21:07:24 <bblfish> that's true
21:08:12 <bblfish> well, I think there should be the options of other formats in there, just in case someone comes up with a really amazing idea for an xml serialisation of rdf
21:08:43 <DanC> the option to expand in the future is always implicitly there.
21:08:52 <bblfish> after all, perhaps when people start groking rdf in big numbers, some genius will work out how to do that right
21:08:53 <bblfish> ok
21:09:05 <DanC> having an option that isn't used (and tested) is not what makes a good standard, in my experience.
21:09:35 <eikeon_> eikeon_ has quit
21:12:39 <bblfish> well it would help to be able enable  break out just to give some people a breath of fresh air
21:13:00 <bblfish> (I just bout that book)
21:13:58 <bblfish> s/bout/bought/
21:16:28 <bblfish> for example I think XSLT transforms can have a dual purpose: help people understand rdf and help machines read rdf
21:17:14 <bblfish> transfomring xml into rdf/xml helps machines, but not humans
21:18:02 <bblfish> you may say you can then transform the xml into turtle, using another tools such as cwm, but that won't get the same quality of output
21:19:02 <perigrin> perigrin has joined #swig
21:19:14 <bblfish> transforming xml to rdf/xml is always going to seem completely bizaar to anyone looking at it who does not understand rdf to start off with very well
21:19:30 <bblfish> it will always seem like a waste of time
21:19:45 <bblfish> and usually it will make things uglier
21:20:14 <chimezie> chimezie has quit
21:21:27 <DanC> I can see your point. I can't muster the fortitude to standardize turtle when it has no expressive capability beyond what we already spent a zillion person-weeks standardizing in RDF/XML
21:22:07 <bblfish> well N3 has more expressive power, you could standardise that :-)
21:23:43 <DanC> yes, well, first I need to understand it. And actually, we _are_ standardizing important aspects of N3 in the rules (RIF) WG. But don't count on the result being pretty. :-/
21:24:27 <bblfish> they want to do it in xml?
21:24:31 <DanC> yes
21:24:41 <DanC> they're chartered to do it in XML
21:24:53 <DanC> I actually think MathML is what they should use.
21:25:13 <perigrin> n3 lacks angle brackets, what will I do with shift-, and shift-.
21:25:29 <DanC> n3 has angle brackets. it uses them for <uris>.
21:25:37 <bblfish> Why don't they standardise N3, then they have rules and all?
21:25:57 <perigrin> bah, it can't truely replace xml unless it uses angle brackets the way lisp uses parens.
21:26:03 <perigrin> er xml/rdf
21:26:27 <bblfish> :-/
21:27:18 <DanC> why don't they standardize N3? some folks would like that. But other folks think it's not sufficiently mature. e.g. how semantics of @forAll mixed with different levels of {}s. And some folks really like XML, XSLT, XPath, and all that.
21:27:43 <DanC> there are a few open research problems in the semantics of N3
21:27:46 <bblfish> but XSLT, XPath, and XQuery are useless as soon as you deal with data
21:28:15 <bblfish> I mean since your tree can be in any shape, Xquery has no use.
21:28:34 <bblfish> and since data does not naturally come in the shape of a tree...
21:28:47 <bblfish> but you know that
21:28:50 <DanC> lots of people prefer to force-fit things into trees
21:29:02 <bblfish> that's what's costing people millions
21:29:13 <perigrin> when all you have is a hammer ...
21:29:22 <bblfish> that's why I think you need to have a system where you can specify a mime type in your GRDDL
21:29:31 <bblfish> that it will output to
21:29:54 <bblfish> that makes it pretty open
21:30:17 <DanC> yes, I suspect it's costing people millions too. But I can't really prove it. So I get research funding, where you don't have to prove that your idea will work before you work on it. you just have to have a good hunch.
21:31:15 <DanC> of course you can use MIME types with GRDDL... but for interoperability, the producers and consumers have to have some MIME types in common
21:31:48 <peace-kee> peace-kee has quit
21:31:50 <DanC> that list can evolve, but it's useful for the core spec to say "all consumers must grok types X, Y, and Z. You can use P, D, and Q and so on, but at your own risk"
21:32:02 <fgiasson> fgiasson has left #swig
21:32:05 <bblfish> well that should be ok
21:32:34 <beobal> beobal has quit
21:32:35 <bblfish> you have to understand rdf/xml, but you could also take trix, or turtle...
21:32:57 <DanC> er... a mime type in the transform? hmm... yes, I guess that makes sense.
21:33:31 <bblfish> mmmm...
21:33:40 <DanC> that's another thing that XSLT has going for it: a standard way to say "here's the MIME type of my output"
21:33:53 <DanC> * DanC wonders if there's a mime type for turtle registered yet
21:34:16 <bblfish> yes there is,( not sure if it is registered though)
21:34:39 <bblfish> but I see the problem... would the client see the xslt?
21:35:02 <DanC> the client typically sees the output of the XSLT...
21:35:19 <DanC> ... which, presumably, includes the mime type, if things are going well
21:36:45 <bblfish> I need to understand the interaction between the client and the server with GRDDL in more detail. I don't have a clear picture
21:37:27 <DanC> well, there's typically no server, except normal web servers
21:37:46 <DanC> the client is somebody who wants RDF data from some document/resource
21:37:53 <yosi_s> yosi_s has quit
21:38:06 <bblfish> so it goes to the name space, asks for the grddl doc
21:38:11 <bblfish> ?
21:38:26 <bblfish> then uses that to transform the xml?
21:38:57 <DanC> hmm... I think we're in pronoun overload already. Shall we pick a concrete example? say, the atom version of your weblog feed?
21:39:07 <bblfish> ok
21:39:07 <DanC> (and the whole thing is implemented in about 50 lines of python http://www.w3.org/2003/g/glean.py )
21:39:29 <hg> hg has quit
21:40:17 <bblfish> ok
21:40:21 <DanC> what's the URL of your weblog feed?
21:41:00 <DanC> the main() routine calls data = grddl(args[0], inf) , i.e. data = grddl("http://...bblfish.atom")
21:41:12 <bblfish> it is http://blogs.sun.com/roller/atom/bblfish
21:41:41 <DanC> ok, so now look at def grddl(), and consider that addr is bound to "http://blogs.sun.com/roller/atom/bblfish"
21:42:02 <DanC> inf is None is true...
21:42:28 <briansuda> briansuda has quit
21:42:29 <DanC> so we call localCopy() and fetch ...atom/bblfish
21:43:12 <bblfish> ok
21:43:13 <DanC> if we got back application/rdf+xml , we'd be done, but we don't...
21:43:29 <bblfish> yes
21:43:46 <DanC> so we recur, this time with inf bound to the local copy we just made...
21:44:18 <DanC> and we get down to getTransforms(inf, addr, already) ...
21:44:43 <dajobe> dajobe has quit
21:44:56 <DanC> which is a bit of a cheat... it calls an outboard XSLT engine because I was too lazy to integrate a python XPath library
21:45:33 <DanC> so to the 50 lines of python, I confess we also add 50 lines of XSLT... http://www.w3.org/2003/g/getTransforms.xsl
21:46:14 <DanC> in getTransforms.xsl, there's some xhtml-specific stuff, which obviously doesn't apply in the case of this atom document...
21:46:53 <bblfish> so you get the namespaces...
21:47:00 <DanC> but extractRootNS is going to print: R http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom
21:47:07 <bblfish> ok
21:47:21 <DanC> then back to the python... if k in ('P', 'R'): profiles.append(u)
21:47:22 <bblfish> (that's not html ;-)
21:47:39 <bblfish> (I mean xml)
21:47:51 <DanC> so now profiles = ["http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom"]
21:48:10 <DanC> and we recur... profileData = grddl(profile, None, already + [profile])
21:48:10 <bblfish> ok
21:48:39 <bblfish> ah I see, so each of your transforms extracts some of the data...
21:48:52 <bblfish> and then you concatenate it
21:48:55 <DanC> in the present world, this gives an empty RDF graph. but imagine it returned { <http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom> grddl:profileTransformation <atom2owl.xsl> }
21:48:59 <DanC> yes. I think you get it now.
21:49:34 <EliasT_> EliasT_ has quit
21:50:53 <DanC> just to complete the story, getTransforms() would return a list containing  <atom2owl.xsl>, and then we'd pop back to grddl() which would run  <atom2owl.xsl> over the content of <...roller/atom/bblfish>, parse that, and return it.
21:52:22 <DanC> in this implementation, since the RDF library I'm using groks turtle, there's pretty much zero cost to supporting turtle... hmm... doXSLT() assumes the output is RDF/XML; it would need to get the mime type somehow. I'm not sure xsltproc outputs it.
21:53:10 <DanC> it would be better to integrate the xslt processor more directly (and do away with getTransforms.xsl)
21:53:35 <kpreid> kpreid has quit
21:53:43 <bblfish> if there are 2 transforms, how do you work out  that parts are mentioning the same blank node?

21:54:40 <bblfish> ].
21:55:15 <bblfish> <entry><author><foaf:mbox>dd</foaf:mbox></author></entry>
21:55:23 <bblfish> the first parse is going to do
21:55:37 <bblfish> [ a :Entry; :author []]
21:56:09 <bblfish> the second parse is going to do [ ] foaf:mbox <dd>??
21:56:45 <bblfish> or does the xslt transform at the atom name space have to deal with all extensions?
21:57:12 <DanC> 2nd parse? I don't follow. where does the 2nd parse come in? does this document have a dataview:transformation that points to a foaf:mbox transformation?
21:57:54 <bblfish> ok, every doc, only has one transform?
21:58:05 <bblfish> the root namespace transform, right?
21:58:28 <DanC> plus as many transforms as you like in the dataview:transformation attribute
22:00:15 <bblfish> Well, now I see that I need to understand this in a lot more detail.
22:00:39 <bblfish> But I am too tired now, as it is midnight. I'll look it up when I wake up
22:01:13 <DanC> midnight? I didn't realize. But yes, dealing with extensions in non-RDF formats is exactly that stuff that is "costing them millions"

22:27:18 <danbri> * danbri guesses his way to https://pip.verisignlabs.com/avatar/connolly.png
22:28:24 <DanC> can you see connolly.png? oh joy... I can see https://pip.verisignlabs.com/avatar/danbri.png , so I suppose so
22:28:49 <danbri> yup
22:29:43 <DanC> yes, the photo is supposed to be an anti-phishing thingy. but the implementation here seems to leave much to be desired. :-/
22:29:47 <danbri> sorry if i shouldn't have posted that... just thinking out loud
22:30:09 <sheets> The images are actually JPEGs but have png extensions... strange.
22:30:11 <danbri> * danbri optimistically assumes verisign puts more thought into such things than he does
22:30:54 <danbri> good to see them boosting the tech tho
22:31:21 <danbri> i had a look at the mediawiki openid support
22:31:40 <danbri> is a big pile of diffs... i doubt it'll get adopted without a lot of lobbying
22:31:50 <schepers> schepers has quit
22:32:15 <DanC> well, I gather wikipedia has already announced intention to support openid
22:32:33 <danbri> oh, i eat my words
22:32:35 <danbri> happily :)
22:32:45 <danbri> that's great
22:32:52 <DanC> supposedly this is a video of that announcement http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7747790812939045407&q=wikipedia
22:33:02 <DanC> Wikipedia is planning to support OpenID

22:37:09 <phenny> sbp: I'll pass that on when crschmidt is around.
22:38:54 <danbri> * danbri sends a note to the verisgnlabs feedback address
22:40:58 <danbri> DanC, do you have a high-level gloss on YADIS vs OpenID?
22:41:11 <danbri> any reason we ought to be enthusing about YADIS instead?
22:44:40 <DanC> I have only the vaguest impressions... yadis seems to have the same functionality as OpenID, plus some XML format for giving name, email address, and maybe shoe size.
22:45:00 <DanC> (shoe size meaning: non-standard properties)
22:45:26 <DanC> I have distant hopes that we can mix RDF in via GRDDL
22:45:56 <DanC> the name/email stuff seems to have been factored out into something called "simple registration"
22:46:05 <danbri> at least it's separable
22:48:58 <danbri> * danbri ponders http://yadis.org/wiki/Yadis_FAQ#Why_is_Yadis_needed.3F_Can.27t_the_same_functionality_be_done_just_with_.3Clink...3E_tags.3F
22:50:41 <DanC> here we have openID + hCard: http://blog.claimid.com/2006/07/better-hcards/

23:08:53 <chimezie> DanC: unfortunately I don't think XSLT inherently can 'drive' the mime-type of it's output.  xsl:output is somewhat limited in it's options: xml, text, html
23:12:52 <chimezie> usually (in my experience anyways) the xsl:output is mapped to a mime-type (associated with the HTTP response) by a web-server for instance.  But such a mapping is not inherent to the transformation mechanism.
23:13:19 <chimezie> so it would seem the consumer would have to know the format ahead of time
23:17:02 <whateley> hmm? <xsl:output media-type="..."/> specifies the output mimetype.
23:17:39 <whateley> anything starting the transform should be able to read that beforehand.
23:18:02 <chimezie> ahh.. silly me
23:20:48 <chimezie> then the consumer has plenty oppurtunity to know ahead of time if it can handle the result or not
